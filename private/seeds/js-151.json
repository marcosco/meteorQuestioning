In those algorithms, you model your graph as if it was a physical object with physical properties. </p>\n\n<p>In this case imagine the nodes of the graph are balls that repel each other, while the edges are springs or rubbers that keep the graph together. The repelling force is stronger the closer the nodes are to each other e.g. inverse square of their distance, and the tension force of each spring is proportional to its length. The repelling force will cause the nodes to get as far as possible from the other nodes and the graph will untie. Of course, you'll have to experiment with coefficients a little to get the best results (but I guarantee - it is a lot of fun).</p>\n\n<p>The main pros of this approach are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>easy to code - nested loops calculating force between every node-node pair and updating node position</li>\n<li>works for all kinds of graphs either planar or nonplanar</li>\n<li>lots of fun to experiment</li>\n<li>if you make it interactive, e.g. allow user to move nodes with a mouse - it attracts people and everyone wants to \"play with the graph\"\n</ol>\n\n<p>The downsides of this approach are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>it can get stuck in a local energy minimum (shaking or helping manually helps)</li>\n<li>it is not extremely fast (but can make a nice animation)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A similar method can be used to layout/untie knots.</p>\n\n<h2>Sample code</h2>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;canvas id=\"canvas\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" style=\"border:1px solid black\"/&gt;

Refresh the page to get different graphs.\nOf course, sometimes it doesn't find the global minimum and there are more crossing edges than it is possible - so if the results don't satisfy you, you can add random shaking.</p>\n\n<h1>Approach 2</h1>\n\n<p>This problem is similar to routing problem in design of PCBs. If you're not satisfied with the simple and easy solution provided by Approach 1, you can improve the solution by using  autorouting methods. E.g. you can put your nodes on a grid and then use A* algorithm to find the shortest paths connecting them. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Use Approach 1 to find a suboptimal initial solution (optional).</li>\n<li>Remove all edges. Place the nodes on a grid (round up their coordinates). The grid must have enough resolution so that no two nodes overlap.</li>\n<li>Sort the edges in ascending approximated length (use Euclidean or Manhattan metric).</li>\n<li>For each edge use A* algorithm to find the shortest route to connect the nodes. As a cost function use not only the distance from the source node, but also add enough large penalty for stepping onto any grid points that are already taken by any edge routed previously.</li>\n<li>Mark the grid points on the path found in the previous step as \"taken\", so all next edges will favour paths not stepping on / intersecting with this path.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The above algorithm is a greedy heuristic and unfortunately it doesn't guarantee the optimal solution, because the result depends on the order of routing the edges. You can further improve the solution by removng a random edge that crosses another edge and reroute it. </p>\n\n<p>Step 1. is optional to make the graph layout more regular and make the average connection distance small, however it should not affect the number of intersections (if the grid has enough resolution).</p>\n",

While it is possible to build and sanitize HTML by string manipulation*, DOM manipulation is far more convenient. Still, you must know exactly which part of your string is HTML and which is literal text.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following example where we have two hard-coded variables:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var href = \"/detail?tag=hr&amp;copy%5B%5D=1\",\n    text = \"The HTML &lt;hr&gt; tag\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The following code naively builds the HTML string:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var div = document.createElement(\"div\");\ndiv.innerHTML = '&lt;a href=\"' + href + '\"&gt;' + text + '&lt;/a&gt;';\nconsole.log(div.innerHTML);\n// &lt;a href=\"/detail?tag=hr\u00a9%5B%5D=1\"&gt;The HTML &lt;hr&gt; tag&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This uses jQuery but it is still incorrect (it uses <code>.html()</code> on a <em>variable that was supposed to be text</em>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>var div = document.createElement(\"div\");\n$(\"&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\").attr(\"href\", href).html(text).appendTo(div);\nconsole.log(div.innerHTML);\n// &lt;a href=\"/detail?tag=hr&amp;amp;copy%5B%5D=1\"&gt;The HTML &lt;hr&gt; tag&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is correct because <em>it displays the text as intended</em>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var div = document.createElement(\"div\");\n$(\"&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\").attr(\"href\", href).text(text).appendTo(div);\nconsole.log(div.innerHTML);\n// &lt;a href=\"/detail?tag=hr&amp;amp;copy%5B%5D=1\"&gt;The HTML &amp;lt;hr&amp;gt; tag&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Conclusion: Using DOM manipulation/jQuery do not guarantee any security, but it sure is one step in right direction.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>* See <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/24816/87015\">this question for examples</a>.

Calculated offset do not matter about change in offset since rotation is done over center of element. </p>\n\n<p>You have to calculate what is that change. Here is workaround, quick and dirty.

Third involves translation of coordinate system for calculated difference. It will offset left and top after translation is performed (note it is first in filter). </p>\n\n<p>If you want to avoid first two rotation filters, You could make code using formula for 2D rotation:</p>\n\n<p>x' = x cos f - y sin f</p>\n\n<p>y' = y cos f + x sin f</p>\n\n<p>where f is angle of rotation, but it's not that simple and also includes more lines of code where you have to calculate what is diagonal angle of original bounding box since you need initial angle of top left corner which x and y coords are comparing to x axis (positive part). Then calculate change in x-x' and y-y'. But I'm predicting some issues with sign of change and coding/debugging would take more time then I have right now.

As several people have pointed out, you needn't transmit those extra newlines and tabs, or spaces; the efficiency cost is small, probably in the neighborhood of 2-5 percent, but you never know when you might need a couple percent.  </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I agree completely that it's a lot more convenient to be able to read the JSON output as prettyprinted text.  But there's another solution -- you're still probably using a browser to look at these results, so instead of prettyprinting it for transmission, use a client-side prettyprinter.  I use <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc\">JSONView for Chrome</a> and <a href=\"http://jsonview.com/\">JSONView</a> in Firefox.

The semantics that everyone is referring all around is actually related to representing rich documents. This includes images and links that allow more richer experience.\nThe same principles can be applied to Word documents, where instead of marking a specific text as red, you can mark it as emphasis and then style the emphasis as red, which will be semantically correct way to express the intend.</p>\n\n<p>The problem arises because HTML actually includes elements that allow user interaction - forms . The initial design was to allow <em>non</em> professionals to create simple interactive UIs. When I checked different desktop GUI frameworks there is no such thing as separation between actual view and view logic, because when you build GUI you don't need that separation.</p>\n\n<p>For me the importance is how much of what you writing is content based or GUI based. Because the HTML serves two purposes it's difficult to know what to serve from the server.\nBasically sites like Wikipedia, and even Stackoverflow are content oriented. This means that if they want to be accessible to broader range of clients, like bots and older browsers they should be able to stream pure html.\nI'm thinking of two possible strategies when you want to provide content and some richer UI experience, like the textare where I'm writing this comment. The one is to server the html and then initialize the GUI. This is also referred as unobtrusive javascript and semantical HTML. This is what most content oriented sites do. This is mostly to be able to benefit from  browsers and bots that will allow their content to be more accessible.\nThe other strategy will be to identify the type of client and serve different content, which can only be achieved reliably only on the client side, because in both cases html will be served. This is still close to the first stategy, because of the way HTML is used/abused as both content and GUI representation.</p>\n\n<p>If you are writing an application that don't provide content but actual service/process then architecture like AngularJS and similar is suited better.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience most business have to provide both. Let's say you have an app that uses HTML/Javascript to allow users to create drawings. This app doesn't need to follow any unobtrusive guidelines, but it won't be able to run on old browsers too. But if you provide a social sharing of the drawings between users, allowing comments and other content then it's better to write this part of the site in a way that bots and other clients can access the content easily.</p>\n",

The result of any selector query is a jQuery object.  It's that jQuery object that contains the myriad of methods that jQuery offers.  <code>.val()</code> is one of those methods as are things like <code>.fadeIn()</code>, <code>.hide()</code>, etc...  Those methods are not methods on a DOM object, but methods of a jQuery object.  Because jQuery objects are general purpose and can hold 0, 1 or more DOM objects in their internal array, you get the same jQuery object back from a jQuery selector call whether the results have 0, 1 or more DOM objects in it.</p>\n\n<p>Thus <code>$j(\"#divID\")</code> that contains only one object returns the same type of object as <code>$j(\".rows\")</code> which might contain hundreds of DOM objects.  This vastly simplifies jQuery programming because you don't have to do things differently depending upon how many objects come back from the selector query.</p>\n\n<p>When you refer to <code>$j(\"divID\")[0]</code>, you are reaching into the jQuery object's internal array of DOM objects (that was populated on the selector query) and fetching the first DOM object in that array.  At that point, you have a normal DOM object, not a jQuery object and you can use normal DOM methods or attributes on it.  Occasionally this is required (to fetch the actual DOM object), but usually, it's easier to just use the methods that jQuery provides on the jQuery object.  There are lots of advantages to using them such as you can chain multiple requests to most methods and it will iterate over all the DOM objects in it's internal array for you automatically.</p>\n\n<p>For example, you you called this: <code>$j(\"rows-even\").hide()</code> and there were 20 rows with that class, then all of them would each be operated on by the hide() method with no more code than this.  Of you could chain multiple methods together like this:  <code>$j(\"rows-even\").slideUp().slideDown()</code>.  In this case, you're running an animation and jQuery will chain these two animations together, automatically starting the second one when the first one finishes.  It's all pretty useful in many circumstances and can save a ton of code  over what would normally have to be written using plain JS.</p>\n",

A crafty user could stick a Greasemonkey script on your page and call exactly the code that your UI calls to send requests. Hiding everything in a Javascript closure only means you need a debugger; it doesn't make an attack impossible. Firebug can trace HTTPS requests. Also consider a compromised client: is there a keylogger installed? Is the entire system secretly running virtualized so that an attacker can inspect any part of memory at any time at their leisure? Security when you're as exposed as a webapp is is really tricky.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, here are a few things for you to consider:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Consider not actually using keys but rather HMAC hashes of, e.g., a token you give immediately upon authentication.</p></li>\n<li><p>DOM storage can be a bit harder to poke at than cookies.</p></li>\n<li><p>Have a look at <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OAuth2.html\">Google's implementation of OAuth 2</a> for an example security model. Basically you use tokens that are only valid for a limited time (and perhaps for a single IP address). That way even if the token is intercepted or cloned, it's only valid for a short length of time. Of course you need to be careful about what you do when the token runs out; could an attacker just do the same thing your code does and get a new valid token?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Don't neglect server-side security: even if your client should have checked before submitting the request, check again on the server if the user actually has permission to do what they're asking. In fact, this advice may obviate most of the above.</p>\n",

Rough overview:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>parse <code>x</code> as HTML</li>\n<li>ask browser extensions for permission</li>\n<li>destroy existing child nodes of <code>element</code></li>\n<li>create child nodes</li>\n<li>recompute styles which are defined in terms of parent-child relationships</li>\n<li>recompute physical dimensions of page elements</li>\n<li>notify browser extensions of the change</li>\n<li>update Javascript variables which are handles to real DOM nodes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All these updates have to go through an API which bridges Javascript and the HTML engine. One reason that Javascript is so fast these days is that we compile it to some faster language or even machine code, masses of optimisations happen because the behaviour of the values is well-defined. When working through the DOM API, <strong>none</strong>  of this is possible. Speedups elsewhere have left the DOM behind.</p>\n",

With IE10, the issue is resolved. By resolved, I mean they have partially moved on to another way of updating DOM. </p>\n\n<p>IE team seems to handle the DOM update similar to Excel-macros team at Microsoft, where it's considered a poor practice to update the live-cells on the sheet. You, the developer, is supposed to take the heavy lifting task offline and then update the live team in batch. In IE you are supposed to do that using document-fragment (as opposed to document). With new emerging ECMA and W3C standards, document-frags are depreciated. So IE team has done some pretty work to contain the issue.</p>\n\n<p>It took them few weeks to strip it down <strong>from ~42,000 ms in IE10-ConsumerPreview to ~600 ms IE10-RTM</strong>. But it took lots of leg pulling to convince them that this IS an issue. Their claim was that there is no real-world example which has 10,000 updates per element. Since the scope and nature of rich-internet-applications (RIAs) can't be predicted, its vital to have performance close to the other browsers of the league. Here is another take on DOM by OP on MS Connect (in comments):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When I browse to <a href=\"http://nontroppo.org/timer/Hixie_DOM.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://nontroppo.org/timer/Hixie_DOM.html</a>, it takes\n  ~680ms and if I save the page and run it locally, it takes ~350ms!</p>\n  \n  <p>Same thing happens if I use button-onclick event to run the script\n  (instead of body-onload). Compare these two versions:</p>\n  \n  <p>jsfiddle.net/uAySs/ &lt;-- body onload </p>\n  \n  <p>vs.</p>\n  \n  <p>jsfiddle.net/8Kagz/ &lt;-- button onclick</p>\n  \n  <p>Almost 2x difference..</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apparently, the underlying behavior of onload and onclick varies as well. It may get even better in future updates. </p>\n",

It is ECMAScript that defines an inheritance scheme, not javascript, so only native ECMAScript objects need to implement that inheritance scheme.</p>\n\n<p>A running javascript program consists of at least the built\u2013in ECMAScript objects (Object, Function, Number, etc.) and probably some native objects (e.g. functions). It may also have some host objects (such as DOM objects in a browser, or other objects in other host environments). </p>\n\n<p>While built\u2013in and native objects must implement the inheritance scheme defined in ECMA-262, host objects do not. Therefore, not all objects in a javascript environment <strong>must</strong> inherit from <em>Object.prototype</em>. For example, host objects in IE implemented as ActiveX objects will throw errors if treated as native objects (hence why try..catch is used to initialise MS XMLHttpRequest objects). Some DOM objects (like NodeLists in IE in quirks mode) if passed to Array methods will throw errors, DOM objects in IE 8 and lower do not have an ECMAScript\u2013like inheritance scheme, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore it should not be assumed that all objects in a javascript environment inherit from Object.prototype.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>which means that each and every object in Javascript has access to the hasOwnProperty function through its prototype chain</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which is not true for certain host objects in IE in quirks mode (and IE 8 and lower always) at least.</p>\n\n<p>Given the above, it's worth pondering why an object might have its own <em>hasOwnProperty</em> method and the advisability of calling some other <em>hasOwnProperty</em> method instead without first testing if that is a good idea or not.</p>\n\n<h3>Edit</h3>\n\n<p>I suspect that the reason for using <code>Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call</code> is that in some browsers, host objects don't have a <em>hasOwnProperty</em> method, using <em>call</em> and the built\u2013in method is an alternative. However, doing so generically doesn't seem like a good idea for the reasons noted above.</p>\n\n<p>Where host objects are concerned, the <em>in</em> operator can be used to test for properties generally, e.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var o = document.getElementsByTagName('foo');\n\n// false in most browsers, throws an error in IE 6, and probably 7 and 8\no.hasOwnProperty('bar');\n\n// false in all browsers\n('bar' in o);\n\n// false (in all browsers? Do some throw errors?)\nObject.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o, 'bar');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>An alternative (tested in IE6 and others):</p>\n\n<pre><code>function ownProp(o, prop) {\n\n  if ('hasOwnProperty' in o) {\n    return o.hasOwnProperty(prop);\n\n  } else {\n    return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o, prop);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That way you only specifically call the built\u2013in <em>hasOwnProperty</em> where the object doesn't have it (inherited or otherwise). </p>\n\n<p>However, if an object doesn't have a <code>hasOwnProperty</code> method, it's probably just as suitable to use the <em>in</em> operator as the object likely doesn't have an inheritance scheme and all properties are on the object (that's just an assumption though), e.g. the <em>in</em> operator is a common (and seemingly successful) way of testing for DOM object support for properties. </p>\n",

Layers with transparent positions can be seen through to below layers (Canvases).

After page load, before image load.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important things to take into consideration:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure js files are cached by the client (all the others stand short compared to this one)</li>\n<li>Compile your code with <a href=\"http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Closure Compiler</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/10/youre-reading-the-worlds-most-dangerous-programming-blog.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deflate your code</a>; it's faster than Gziping it (on both ends)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Apache example of caching:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Set up caching on media files for 1 month\n&lt;FilesMatch \"\\.(gif|jpg|jpeg|png|swf|js|css)$\"&gt;\n    ExpiresDefault A2629744\n    Header append Cache-Control \"public, proxy-revalidate\"\n    Header append Vary \"Accept-Encoding: *\"\n&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Apache example of deflating:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// compresses all files for faster transfer\nLoadModule deflate_module modules/mod_deflate.so\nAddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml font/opentype font/truetype font/woff\n&lt;FilesMatch \"\\.(js|css|html|htm|php|xml)$\"&gt;\n   SetOutputFilter DEFLATE\n&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And last, and probably least, serve your Javascript from a cookie-less domain.</p>\n\n<p>And to keep your question in focus, remember that when you have DFN code, you'll have several smaller javascript files that, precisely for being split, won't have the level of compression Closure can give you with a single one.

I have gone through most of the YSlow and Google Page Speed stuff, but am left wondering about a particular detail.</p>\n\n<p>A key thing for me here is that the site I'm working on is not on the public net; it's a business to business platform where almost all users are repeat visitors (and therefore with caches of the data, which is something that YSlow assumes will not be the case for a large number of visitors).</p>\n\n<p>First up, the standard approach recommended by tools such as YSlow is to concatenate it, compress it, and serve it up in a single file loaded at the end of your page.  This approach sounds reasonably effective, but I think that a key part of the reasoning here is to improve performance for users without cached data.</p>\n\n<p>The system I currently have is something like this</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All javascript files are compressed and loaded at the bottom of the page</li>\n<li>All javascript files have far future cache expiration dates, so will remain (for most users) in the cache for a long time</li>\n<li>Pages only load the javascript files that they require, rather than loading one monolithic file, most of which will not be required</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, my understanding is that, if the cache expiration date for a javascript file has not been reached, then the cached version is used immediately; there is no HTTP request sent at to the server at all.  If this is correct, I would assume that having multiple  tags is not causing any performance penalty, as I'm still not having any additional requests on most pages (recalling from above that almost all users have populated caches).</p>\n\n<p>In addition to this, not loading the JS means that the browser doesn't have to interpret or execute all this additional code which it isn't going to need; as a B2B application, most of our users are unfortunately stuck with IE6 and its painfully slow JS engine.</p>\n\n<p>Another benefit is that, when code changes, only the affected files need to be fetched again, rather than the whole set (granted, it would only need to be fetched once, so this is not so much of a benefit).</p>\n\n<p>I'm also looking at using <a href=\"http://www.labjs.com/\">LabJS</a> to allow for parallel loading of the JS when it's not cached.</p>\n\n<p>Specific questions</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If there are many  tags, but all files are being loaded from the local cache, and less javascript is being loaded overall, is this going to be faster than one  tag which is also being loaded from the cache, but contains all the javascript needed anywhere on the site, rather than an appropriate subset?</li>\n<li>Are there any other reasons to prefer one over the other?</li>\n<li>Does similar thinking apply to CSS? (I'm currently using a much more monolithic approach to CSS)</li>\n</ul>\n",

However, implementing this matter of considerable sweat, so answers of the form of \"you can use a parser result to get what you want\" rather miss the point.</p>\n\n<p>If you could apply all this machinery, what you'll get as a practical result is a <em>conservative</em> answer, e.g., \"A may call B\".  This is all you know anyway, consider </p>\n\n<pre><code> void A(int x,y) { if (x&gt;y) foo.B(); }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Because a tool sometime simply can't reason about complex logic, you may get \"A may call B\" even when the application designer knows it isn't  possible:</p>\n\n<pre><code> void A(int x) // programmer asserts x&lt;4\n   { if (x&gt;5) foo.B(); }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>eval</em> makes the problem worse, because you need to track string value results that arrive at eval commands and parse them to get some kind of clue as to what code is being evaled, and which functions that eval'd code might call.   Things get really nasty if somebody passes \"eval\" in a string to eval :-{ You also likely need to model the program execution context; I suspect there are lots of browser APIs that include callbacks. </p>\n\n<p>If somebody offers you tool that has all the necessary machinery completely configured to solve your problem out of the box, that would obviously be great.  My suspicion is you won't get such an offer, because such a tool doesn't exist. The reason is all that infrastructure needed; its hard to build and hardly anybody can justify it for just one tool. Even an \"optimizing JavaScript compiler\" if you can find one likely won't have all this machinery, especially the global  analysis, and what it does have is unlikely to be packaged in a form designed for easy consumption for your purpose.</p>\n\n<p>I've been beating my head on this problem since I started programming in 1969 (some of my programs back then were compilers and I wanted all this stuff).  The only way to get this is to amortize the cost of all this machinery across <em>lots</em> of tools.</p>\n\n<p>My company offers the <a href=\"http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/DMS/DMSToolkit.html\">DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit</a>, a package of generic compiler analysis and transformation machinery, with a variety of industrial strength computer langauge front-ends (including C, C++, COBOL and yes, JavaScript).   DMS offers APIs to enable custom tools to be constructed on its generic foundations.</p>\n\n<p>The generic machinery listed at the top of the message is all present in DMS, including <a href=\"http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/DMS/FlowAnalysis.html\">control flow graph and data flow analysis</a> available through a clean documented API. That flow analysis has to be tied to specific language front ends.  That takes some work too, and so we haven't done it for all languages yet.  We have done this for C [tested on systems of 18,000 compilation units as a monolith, including computing the call graph for the 250,000 functions present, including indirect function calls!], COBOL and Java and we're working on C++.  </p>\n\n<p>DMS has the same \"JavaScript\" parser answer as other answers in this thread, and viewed from just that perspective DMS isn't any better than the other answers that say \"build it on top of a parser\".  The distinction should be clear: the <em>machinery</em> is already present in DMS, so the work is not one of implement the machinery and tying to the parser; it is just tying it to the parser.  This is still a bit of work, but a hell of a lot less than if you just start with a parser.</p>\n",

Isn't that single thread will continue working on other requests? Then who is going to keep working on setTimeout while other requests keep coming and get executed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There's only 1 thread in the node process that will actually execute your program's JavaScript. However, within node itself, there are actually several threads handling operation of the event loop mechanism, and this includes a pool of IO threads and a handful of others. The key is the number of these threads does not correspond to the number of concurrent connections being handled like they would in a thread-per-connection concurrency model.</p>\n\n<p>Now about \"executing setTimeouts\", when you invoke <code>setTimeout</code>, all node does is basically update a data structure of functions to be executed at a time in the future. It basically has a bunch of queues of stuff that needs doing and every \"tick\" of the event loop it selects one, removes it from the queue, and runs it.</p>\n\n<p>A key thing to understand is that node relies on the OS for most of the heavy lifting. So incoming network requests are actually tracked by the OS itself and when node is ready to handle one it just uses a system call to ask the OS for a network request with data ready to be processed. So much of the IO \"work\" node does is either \"Hey OS, got a network connection with data ready to read?\" or \"Hey OS, any of my outstanding filesystem calls have data ready?\". Based upon its internal algorithm and event loop engine design, node will select one \"tick\" of JavaScript to execute, run it, then repeat the process all over again. That's what is meant by the event loop. Node is basically at all times determining \"what's the next little bit of JavaScript I should run?\", then running it. This factors in which IO the OS has completed, and things that have been queued up in JavaScript via calls to <code>setTimeout</code> or <code>process.nextTick</code>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2: If these setTimeout will get executed behind the scenes while more requests are coming and in and being executed, the thing carry out the async executions behind the scenes is that the one we are talking about EventLoop?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No JavaScript gets executed behind the scenes. All the JavaScript in your program runs front and center, one at a time. What happens behind the scenes is the OS handles IO and node waits for that to be ready and node manages its queue of javascript waiting to execute.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>3: How can JS Engine know if it is an async function so that it can put it in the EventLoop?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a fixed set of functions in node core that are async because they make system calls and node knows which these are because they have to call the OS or C++. Basically all network and filesystem IO as well as child process interactions will be asynchronous and the ONLY way JavaScript can get node to run something asynchronously is by invoking one of the async functions provided by the node core library. Even if you are using an npm package that defines it's own API, in order to yield the event loop, eventually that npm package's code will call one of node core's async functions and that's when node knows the tick is complete and it can start the event loop algorithm again.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>4 The Event Loop is a queue of callback functions. When an async function executes, the callback function is pushed into the queue. The JavaScript engine doesn't start processing the event loop until the code after an async function has executed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, this is true, but it's misleading. The key thing is the normal pattern is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Let's say this code is running in tick 1\nfs.readFile(\"/home/barney/colors.txt\", function (error, data) {\n  //The code inside this callback function will absolutely NOT run in tick 1\n  //It will run in some tick &gt;= 2\n});\n//This code will absolutely also run in tick 1\n//HOWEVER, typically there's not much else to do here,\n//so at some point soon after queueing up some async IO, this tick\n//will have nothing useful to do so it will just end because the IO result\n//is necessary before anything useful can be done\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So yes, you could totally block the event loop by just counting Fibonacci numbers synchronously all in memory all in the same tick, and yes that would totally freeze up your program. It's cooperative concurrency. Every tick of JavaScript must yield the event loop within some reasonable amount of time or the overall architecture fails.</p>\n",

The first two calls are sync calls. But when it comes to <code>setTimeout</code> method, it becomes an async execution. But JS immediately returns from it and continue executing, which is called <code>Non-Blocking</code> or <code>Async</code>. And it continues working on other etc.</p>\n\n<p>The results of this execution is the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a c d b</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So basically the second <code>setTimeout</code> got finished first and its callback function gets executed earlier than the first one and that makes sense.</p>\n\n<p>We are talking about single-threaded application here. JS Engine keeps executing this and unless it finishes the first request, it won't go to second one. But the good thing it won't wait blocking operations like <code>setTimeout</code> so it will be a fast operation to accept the new incoming requests.</p>\n\n<p>But my questions arises around the following items:</p>\n\n<p><strong>#1:</strong> If we are talking about a single-threaded application, then what processes <code>setTimeouts</code> while JS engine accepts more requests and executes them? Isn't that single thread will continue working on other requests? Then who is going to keep working on <code>setTimeout</code> while other requests keep coming and get executed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#2:</strong> If these <code>setTimeout</code> will get executed behind the scenes while more requests are coming and in and being executed, the thing carry out the async executions behind the scenes is that the one we are talking about <code>EventLoop</code>?</p>\n\n<p><strong>#3:</strong> But isn't that the whole method should be put in the <code>EventLoop</code> so that the whole thing get executed and callback method gets called? This is what I understand when talking about callback functions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function downloadFile(filePath, callback)\n{\n  blah.downloadFile(filePath);\n  callback();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But in this case, How can JS Engine know if it is an async function so that it can put it in the <code>EventLoop? Perhaps something like</code>async` keyword like in C# or some sort of an attribute which indicates the method JS Engine will take on is an async method and should be treated accordingly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#4:</strong> But an <a href=\"http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/event-based-programming-what-async-has-over-sync--net-30027\">article</a> says quite contrary to what I was guessing on how things might be working:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Event Loop is a queue of callback functions. When an async\n  function executes, the callback function is pushed into the queue. The\n  JavaScript engine doesn't start processing the event loop until the\n  code after an async function has executed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>#5:</strong> And there is this image here which might be helpful but the first explanation in the image is saying exactly the same thing mentioned in question number 4:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zYgcr.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>So my question here is to get some clarifications about the items listed above?</p>\n",

So the idea is now to create a custom overlay for the SVG, as explained <a href=\"http://code.google.com/intl/fr-FR/apis/maps/documentation/overlays.html#Custom%5FOverlays\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>That's the reason why I asked for <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1071328/how-to-produce-same-result-on-different-browsers-when-embedding-svg-file-in-html\">this question</a> (I am sorry, but HTML/javascript are not my strongest points).</p>\n\n<p>And since there is a small bug with Webkit for rendering a SVG with transparent background with <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>element, I need to use <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> accordingly to the browser (I don't like this, but... for the moment, it's still the quick-and-dirty experiments)</p>\n\n<p>So I started with this code (still work in progress):</p>\n\n<pre><code>// create the object\nfunction myOverlay(SVGurl, bounds)\n{\n    this.url_ = SVGurl;\n    this.bounds_ = bounds;\n}\n\n// prototype\nmyOverlay.prototype = new GOverlay();\n\n// initialize\nmyOverlay.prototype.initialize = function(map)\n{\n    // create the div\n    var div = document.createElement(\"div\");\n    div.style.position = \"absolute\";\n    div.setAttribute('id',\"SVGdiv\");\n    div.setAttribute('width',\"900px\");\n    div.setAttribute('height',\"900px\");\n\n    // add it with the same z-index as the map\n    this.map_ = map;\n    this.div_ = div;\n\n    //create new svg root element and set attributes\n    var svgRoot;\n    if (BrowserDetect.browser=='Safari')\n    {\n    \t// Bug in webkit: with &lt;objec&gt; element, Safari put a white background... :-(\n    \tsvgRoot = document.createElement(\"img\");\n    \tsvgRoot.setAttribute(\"id\", \"SVGelement\");\n    \tsvgRoot.setAttribute(\"type\", \"image/svg+xml\");\n    \tsvgRoot.setAttribute(\"style\",\"width:900px;height:900px\");\n    \tsvgRoot.setAttribute(\"src\", \"test.svg\");\n    }\n    else //if (BrowserDetect.browser=='Firefox')\n    {\n    \tsvgRoot = document.createElement(\"object\");\n    \tsvgRoot.setAttribute(\"id\", \"SVGelement\");\n    \tsvgRoot.setAttribute(\"type\", \"image/svg+xml\");\n    \tsvgRoot.setAttribute(\"style\",\"width:900px;height:900px;\");\n    \tsvgRoot.setAttribute(\"data\", \"test.svg\");\n    }\n\n\n    div.appendChild(svgRoot);\n    map.getPane(G_MAP_MAP_PANE).appendChild(div);\n\n    //this.redraw(true);\n} \n\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>draw</code> function is not yet written.</p>\n\n<p>I still have a problem (I progress slowly, thanks to what I read/learn everywhere, and also thanks to people who answer my questions).</p>\n\n<p>Now, the problem is the following : with the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag, the map is not draggable. All over the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> element, the mouse pointer is not \"the hand icon\" to drag the map, but just the normal pointer.</p>\n\n<p>And I did not find how to correct this. Should I add a new mouse event (I just saw mouse event when a click or a double-click append, but not for dragging the map...) ?</p>\n\n<p>Or is there another way to add this layer so as to preserve the drag-ability ?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your comments and answers.</p>\n\n<p>PS: I also try to add one by one the elements of my SVG, but... in fact...

What I'm looking for is somewhere halfway between the traditional birds eye view and the old SNES mode7 view. Just a slight angle to give the illusion of 3D.</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to figure out what is going to be the best way to deal with the perspective skewing. I'm not doing rotations so 3D matrix stuff would be going overboard, but I need to be able to deal with rendering the map layers at a consistent angle and it'd be nice if the angle was adjustable. I also need to deal with the depth warp. Basically, the bottom row of pixels should be 1:1 pixel width and height, then for each row it'd get, for example, 5% smaller or something like that. What I'd like is to be able to supply a large canvas as a texture and then supply a camera angle between 0 and 90 where 0 is perfectly horizontal and 90 is birds eye view.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone have any related tutorials or sample code? I've searched online a bit, but everything I've found seems to either be unsuitable for use in this particular application or overly complex, doing all sorts of crazy 3D skewing and rotation stuff. All I want is to take the normal tiled grid and lean it back a bit, no rotations or complicated stuff like that.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example of what I want;\n<img src=\"http://img801.imageshack.us/img801/2176/perspectivesample.jpg\" alt=\"Here's an example.\"></p>\n\n<p>The bottom pixel row is 1:1 pixel ratio, and each row above that progressively gets shorter horizontally and vertically. The source texture of the top center region is normally about half the height of the bottom center region, but it has been shrunk vertically and horizontally to fit the perspective.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm thinking might work best is to render the current viewport state to another canvas in flat, birds eye view, with approximately 50% extra space on the top and sides, then slice an upside triangular region from that and draw that to the actual visible canvas.</p>\n\n<p>Only problem is, I suck at math when it comes to calculating angles and such.</p>\n",

So the code on the client which looks at a site on domain \"A\" could look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;img src=\"www.domainB.com/?getCookie.php?sessionID=1234\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now comes the funny part, server B reads on server-side the cookie set by domain \"B\" and writes the result with the provided session-id either in a DB accessible by domain \"A\" or returns a response which contains the cookie information to the client on domain \"A\" which then sends it via AJAX to server \"A\".</p>\n\n<p>I am pretty sure there is a flaw we didn't find yet. I personally believe server \"B\" will not be able to read cookie informations because the client-browsers URL points to domain \"A\", but of course the \"getCookie\"-request explained above points to \"B\".</p>\n\n<p>Please tell us what you think about it, why it works or why it can't work.

Change slick.remotemodel.js to yourRemoteModel.js.  Eliminate any duplicate scripts - for exmaple, if you already are pulling in a recent version of jQuery then eliminate the line in \"mygrid.html\" that pulls in jquery-1.4.3.min.js.</p></li>\n<li><p>In \"mygrid.html\", change the initialization of the 'columns' variable to match the data you want to display from your database.  Pay attention to the field property.  This must agree with the property names that will be returned in the JSON response from your server. (*see note about this at the end).</p></li>\n<li><p>In yourRemoteModel.js, change the url variable to point to your server, passing appropriate arguments.  In my case I pass page and rows paramters to my server like this:</p>\n\n<p>var url = myServerUrl+\"?page=\"+fromPage+\"&amp;rows=\"+(((toPage - fromPage) * PAGESIZE) + PAGESIZE);</p></li>\n<li><p>In yourRemoteModel.js, change the jsonp call to ajax - unless you need to do this cross-domain, in which case you'll want to stay with jsonp, otherwise you can change it to look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>        req = $.ajax({\n            url: url,\n            dataType: 'json',\n            success: onSuccess,\n            error: function(){\n                onError(fromPage, toPage)\n            }\n            });\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>In yourRemoteModel.js, you must now customize the onSuccess() function.  Follow the pattern of the example, setting <em>from</em> and <em>to</em> be the integer offsets into the data records, setting data.length to be the total number of records, and then setting the data array. This code is dependent on what the JSON response from your server looks like.</p></li>\n<li><p>Now write the code on the server to generate the JSON response.  As you can see from step 7, this needs to include the record (or page) offset into the data, and an indication of how many records are being returned, as well as an array of the records themselves.  Remember that each field of each record must have a property name that matches the 'field' setting in your column definitions (from step 4 above).  Take a look at the response from Digg as an example:</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://services.digg.com/search/stories?query=apple&amp;offset=0&amp;appkey=http://slickgrid.googlecode.com&amp;type=javascript&amp;callback=cb\">http://services.digg.com/search/stories?query=apple&amp;offset=0&amp;appkey=http://slickgrid.googlecode.com&amp;type=javascript&amp;callback=cb</a></p>\n\n<p>And that should do it!</p>\n\n<p>*Note:  in my case I didn't want to use the bandwidth to return all those property names repeated for every record in the JSON response, so instead I return an array of the record values.  I then set the field property in the column description (step 4 above) to be an integer offset into this array.  So in the column descriptions, instead of field:'someFieldName\", I use field:3, then in my remote model, onSuccess() function I'm setting data[from+i] = resp.record[i].data (where .data is an array in the JSON response of the field values in the record).  So far this seems to be working well for me (but might be harder to debug if something goes wrong).</p>\n",

The browser will fetch the image from the server automatically.</p>\n\n<p>Examples:</p>\n\n<p>ex-1:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var img_src = \"http://someserver/yourimage.png\";\nvar node = document.getElementById('the-node-in-which-i-want-my-image');\nnode.innerHTML = \"&lt;img src='\"+img_src+\"' alt='my image'&gt;\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>ex-2: (using jquery) - this is essentially the same as above, only much easier to write:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var img_src = \"http://someserver/yourimage.png\";\n$('#the-node-in-which-i-want-my-image')\n    .html(\"&lt;img src='\"+img_src+\"' alt='my image'&gt;\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, there's one more thing: the browser starts fetching the image <em>after</em> this code runs, so the image actually appears a little after you insert it into the DOM.</p>\n\n<p>To prevent this, you can pre-fetch the images using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var prefetch = new Image();\nprefetch.src = \"http://someserver/yourimage.png\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n",

                    "body": "<p>There are a number of cases you're not handling here.  The best bet is to start by building the promise as a state machine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var PENDING = 0;\nvar FULFILLED = 1;\nvar REJECTED = 2;\n\nfunction Promise() {\n\n  // store state which can be PENDING, FULFILLED or REJECTED\n  var state = PENDING;\n\n  // store value once FULFILLED or REJECTED\n  var value = null;\n\n  // store sucess &amp; failure handlers\n  var handlers = [];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now lets define a simple helper to use through the rest of our implementation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// a function that returns `then` if `value` is a promise, otherwise `null`\nfunction getThen(value) {\n  if (result &amp;&amp; (typeof result === 'object' || typeof result === 'function')) {\n    var then = value.then;\n    if (typeof then === 'function') {\n      return then;\n    }\n  }\n  return null;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next, we need to consider each of the transformations that can occur:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var PENDING = 0;\nvar FULFILLED = 1;\nvar REJECTED = 2;\n\nfunction Promise() {\n\n  // store state which can be PENDING, FULFILLED or REJECTED\n  var state = PENDING;\n\n  // store value once FULFILLED or REJECTED\n  var value = null;\n\n  // store sucess &amp; failure handlers\n  var handlers = [];\n\n  function resolve(result) {\n    try {\n      var then = getThen(result);\n      if (then) {\n        doResolve(then.bind(result), resolve, reject)\n        return\n      }\n      state = FULFILLED;\n      value = result;\n    } catch (e) {\n      reject(e);\n    }\n  }\n\n  function reject(error) {\n    state = REJECTED;\n    value = error;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note how <code>resolve</code> can receive a Promise as its argument, but a Promise can never be fulfilled with another Promise.  So we have to handle this special case.</p>\n\n<p>Note also that a Promise can only ever be fulfilled/rejected once.  We also have the problem that a third party Promise may misbehave, and we should guard our code against that.  For this reason, I haven't just called <code>result.then(resolve, reject)</code> from within <code>resolve</code>.  Instead, I split that into a separate function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/**\n * Take a potentially misbehaving resolver function and make sure\n * onFulfilled and onRejected are only called once.\n *\n * Makes no guarantees about asynchrony.\n */\nfunction doResolve(fn, onFulfilled, onRejected) {\n  var done = false;\n  try {\n    fn(function (value) {\n      if (done) return\n      done = true\n      onFulfilled(value)\n    }, function (reason) {\n      if (done) return\n      done = true\n      onRejected(reason)\n    })\n  } catch (ex) {\n    if (done) return\n    done = true\n    onRejected(ex)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So now we have a completed state machine, but no way to observe or trigger the changes in state.  Lets start by adding a way to trigger the state changes by passing in a resolver function.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function Promise(fn) {\n  if (typeof this !== 'object')\n    throw new TypeError('Promises must be constructed via new');\n  if (typeof fn !== 'function')\n    throw new TypeError('fn must be a function');\n\n  // store state which can be PENDING, FULFILLED or REJECTED\n  var state = PENDING;\n\n  // store value once FULFILLED or REJECTED\n  var value = null;\n\n  // store sucess &amp; failure handlers\n  var handlers = [];\n\n  function resolve(result) {\n    try {\n      var then = getThen(result);\n      if (then) {\n        doResolve(then.bind(result), resolve, reject)\n        return\n      }\n      state = FULFILLED;\n      value = result;\n    } catch (e) {\n      reject(e);\n    }\n  }\n\n  function reject(error) {\n    state = REJECTED;\n    value = error;\n  }\n\n  doResolve(fn, resolve, reject);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, we re-use <code>doResolve</code> because we have another un-trusted resolver.  The <code>fn</code> might call <code>resolve</code> or <code>reject</code> multiple times, and it might throw an error.  We need to handle all of these cases (and that's what <code>doResolve</code> does).</p>\n\n<p>We now have the completed state machine, but we haven't exposed any information about what state it is in.  Lets try adding a <code>.done(onFulfilled, onRejected)</code> method that is just like <code>.then</code> except that it does not return a Promise and does not handle errors thrown by <code>onFulfilled</code> and <code>onRejected</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var PENDING = 0;\nvar FULFILLED = 1;\nvar REJECTED = 2;\n\nfunction Promise(fn) {\n  if (typeof this !== 'object')\n    throw new TypeError('Promises must be constructed via new');\n  if (typeof fn !== 'function')\n    throw new TypeError('fn must be a function');\n\n  // store state which can be PENDING, FULFILLED or REJECTED\n  var state = PENDING;\n\n  // store value once FULFILLED or REJECTED\n  var value = null;\n\n  // store sucess &amp; failure handlers\n  var handlers = [];\n\n  function resolve(result) {\n    try {\n      var then = getThen(result);\n      if (then) {\n        doResolve(then.bind(result), resolve, reject)\n        return\n      }\n      state = FULFILLED;\n      value = result;\n      handlers.forEach(handle);\n      handlers = null;\n    } catch (e) {\n      reject(e);\n    }\n  }\n\n  function reject(error) {\n    state = REJECTED;\n    value = error;\n    handlers.forEach(handle);\n    handlers = null;\n  }\n\n  function handle(handler) {\n    if (state === PENDING) {\n      handlers.push(handler);\n    } else {\n      if (state === FULFILLED &amp;&amp; typeof handler.onFulfilled === 'function') {\n        handler.onFulfilled(value);\n      }\n      if (state === REJECTED &amp;&amp; typeof handler.onRejected === 'function') {\n        handler.onRejected(value);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  this.done = function (onFulfilled, onRejected) {\n    setTimeout(function () { // ensure we are always asynchronous\n      handle({\n        onFulfilled: onFulfilled,\n        onRejected: onRejected\n      });\n    }, 0);\n  }\n\n  doResolve(fn, resolve, reject);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note how we must handle the case of <code>.done</code> being called both before and after the Promise becomes fulfilled/rejected.</p>\n\n<p>We almost have a complete promise implementation, but, as you already noticed when building your own implementation, we need a <code>.then</code> method that returns a Promise.</p>\n\n<p>We can build this easilly out of <code>.done</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.then = function (onFulfilled, onRejected) {\n  var self = this;\n  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n    return self.done(function (result) {\n      if (typeof onFulfilled === 'function') {\n        try {\n          return resolve(onFulfilled(result));\n        } catch (ex) {\n          return reject(ex);\n        }\n      } else {\n        return resolve(result);\n      }\n    }, function (error) {\n      if (typeof onRejected === 'function') {\n        try {\n          return resolve(onRejected(error));\n        } catch (ex) {\n          return reject(ex);\n        }\n      } else {\n        return reject(error);\n      }\n    });\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note here how we get the thing you were struggling with for free now, because <code>resolve</code> accepts a Promise and waits for it to be resolved.</p>\n\n<p><strong>N.B.</strong> I haven't tested this Promise implementation (although it is correct to the best of my knowledge).  You should test any implementation you build against the Promises/A+ test suite (<a href=\"https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests\">https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests</a>) and may also find the Promises/A+ spec (<a href=\"https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec\">https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec</a>) useful in figuring out what the correct behavior is for any specific part of the algorithm.  As a final resource, <a href=\"https://github.com/then/promise/blob/master/core.js\">promise</a> is a very minimal implementation of the Promise spec.</p>\n",

Not sure if the second argument is accepteable according to promise specs, but that's what I got so far.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Aaa=function(f,pause) { \n\n    console.log(\"ggg\");\n\n    var t=this;\n    this.f=f;\n    this.thens=[];\n\n    this.resolve=function(g) {\n\n        for(var i=0;i&lt;t.thens.length;i++)\n        {\n            // try/catch to be used later for dealing with exceptions\n\n            try\n            {\n                t.thens[i].f(g);\n                t.thens[i].resolve();\n            }   \n            catch(ex)\n            {}\n\n        }\n    };  \n\n    // to be implemented later\n    this.reject=function(g) {};\n\n    this.then=function(resolve,reject) {\n\n        // i'm passing true for pause argument as we dont need to execute promise code just yet\n        var nextPromise=new Aaa(resolve,true);\n\n        this.thens.push(nextPromise);\n\n        return nextPromise;\n    }\n\n\n    if(!pause)\n        this.f(this.resolve,this.reject); \n\n}\n\n\nvar aaa=new Aaa(function(resolve,reject) {\n\n    console.log(\"aaa\");\n\n    setTimeout(function() {\n\n        console.log(\"fff\");\n        resolve(\"good\");\n\n    },2000);\n\n    console.log(\"bbb\");\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So now the promise can be created, called and resolved. Each <code>then</code> method will return new Aaa (Promise) so these can be chained. Now the code below uses promise created above and chains <code>then</code> callbacks. Each <code>then</code> returns new promise and in this case it seems to work fine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>aaa.then(function(res) {\n\n    console.log(\"ccc\");\n    console.log(res);\n\n})\n.then(function(res) {\n    console.log(\"ddd\");\n    console.log(res);\n},function(rej) {\n    console.log(\"eee\");\n    console.log(rej);\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the output I'm getting is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ggg\naaa \nbbb \nggg \nggg \nfff \nccc \ngood \nddd \nundefined \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is however when one of the <code>then</code> calls returns a promise:</p>\n\n<pre><code>aaa.then(function(res) {\n\n    console.log(\"ccc\");\n    console.log(res);\n\n    // here we return the promise manually. then next then call where \"ddd\" is output should not be called UNTIL this promise is resolved. How to do that?\n\n        return new Aaa(function(resolve,reject) {\n\n        console.log(\"iii\");\n\n        setTimeout(function() {\n        console.log(\"kkk\");\n            resolve(\"good2\");\n            // reject(\"bad\");\n\n        },2000);\n\n        console.log(\"jjj\");\n\n    }).then(function (res) {\n        console.log(\"lll\");\n\n        console.log(res);\n    });\n\n})\n.then(function(res) {\n    console.log(\"ddd\");\n    console.log(res);\n},function(rej) {\n    console.log(\"eee\");\n    console.log(rej);\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The output is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ggg \naaa \nbbb \nggg \nggg  \nfff  \nccc  \ngood  \nggg  \niii  \njjj  \nggg  \nddd  \nundefined  \nkkk  \nlll  \ngood2 \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The call then where <code>ddd</code> is output should not be called UNTIL the returned promise we just added is resolved. </p>\n\n<p>How would that be best implemented? </p>\n",

                    "body": "<p>It's probably faster to build the HTML for the entire row and add the row to the table rather than adding each individual element one at a time.  You could also extend that to building all of the HTML in a string, then adding it all at one go, which would be even faster.  In an MVC environment, I'd probably return a partial view (HTML) that has the table since that would maintain separation of concerns.  I would avoid building HTML on the server (in a controller), though, as that would mean that you'd have to change code whenever you wanted to change how the table was displayed.  If you're using PHP or another scripting language, then filter as appropriate for your environment.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var html = '';\nfor (var key=0, size=data.length; key&lt;size;key++) {\n\n  html += '&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'\n             + data[key][0]\n             + '&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=\"whatever1\"&gt;'\n             + data[key][1]\n             + '&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=\"whatever2\"&gt;'\n             + data[key][2]\n             + '&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;';\n}\n\n$('#dataTable').append(html);\n</code></pre>\n",

The line of longitude at latitude l will be cos(l)*40,075 km. One degree of longitude will be 1/360th of that.</p>\n\n<p>So you can work backwards from that. Assuming you want something very close to one square kilometre, you'll want 1 * (360/40075) = 0.008983 degrees of latitude.</p>\n\n<p>At your example latitude of 53.38292839, the line of longitude will be cos(53.38292839)*40075 = [approx] 23903.297 km long.

And the above gives a really good answer for most of the useful area of the world, but is prone to go a little odd near the poles (where rectangles in long/lat stop looking anything like rectangles on the globe). If you were on the equator, for example, the hypothetical line of longitude is 0 km long. So how you'd deal with a need to count degrees on that will depend on why you want the numbers.</p>\n",

Object can be considered as \"all the non-native items\" of a language, where for \"native item\" I mean basic types like integers, characters etc.</p>\n\n<p>In the braces {} you pass the value of some variable or method. This is called, as  Tomasz Nurkiewicz previusly explained, a constructor, because it allows you to 'construct' a new object whose model has been described elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p>To give you a known example: you write</p>\n\n<pre><code>myArray = new Array();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It means that you are creating a new Array, which is a non-native object which has been defined elsewhere. you can also write:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myArray = new Array([1,2,3,4,5]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And it fills the array with the given numbers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SECOND: modify definition of an existing object</strong>\n(i.e. The project of the house)</p>\n\n<p>with </p>\n\n<pre><code>TestModel = Backbone.Model.extend({ title: \"test title\" })\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>you say something very simple to your VM: \"the object you give me as default is very nice, but I want to implement more functions/properties\".\nSo with the \"extend\" clause you modify the definition of an object adding or override existing method/properties. </p>\n\n<p>Example: a nice example in <a href=\"http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/\">backbone.js</a> is given by the comparator function of a collection. When you extend the object defining it, \"it will be used to maintain the collection in sorted order\".</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myCollection= Backbone.Collection.extend({\n    comparator:function(){\n       return item.get('name');\n       }\n    });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>IN GENERAL</strong></p>\n\n<p>What you are expected to do when 'backboning' (=developing using backbone.js framework) is to extend the given object (for instance a View) with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>window.buttonView=Backbone.View.extend({\n    btnText:'nothingByDefault',\n    myNewMethod:function(){\n       //do whatever you want, maybe do something triggered bby an event, for instance\n       }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then use it somewhere else in the code, once for each button you want to handle, includeing in the braces all the values you want to give to the object</p>\n\n<pre><code>[...]\nvar submitBtn = new buttonView({btnText:\"SubmitMe!\"}),\nvar cancelBtn = new buttonView({btnText:\"Erase All!\"});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>....Hope this helps...</p>\n",
