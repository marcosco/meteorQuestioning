It is perhaps a bit plain but it is ready and it is there.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You do not need to use bootstrap-theme.css if you don't want to and things will be just fine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Bootstrap-theme.css</strong> is just what the name of the file is trying to suggest: it is a theme for bootstrap that is creatively considered 'THE bootstrap theme'. The name of the file confuses things just a bit since the base bootstrap.css already has styling applied and I, for one, would consider those styles to be the default. But that conclusion is apparently incorrect in light of things said in the Bootstrap documentation's examples section in regard to this bootstrap-theme.css file:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Load the optional Bootstrap theme for a visually enhanced experience.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above quote is found here <em><a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples\">http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples</a></em> on a thumbnail that links to this example page <em><a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/examples/theme/\">http://getbootstrap.com/examples/theme/</a></em>.

So, you should definitely NOT use a theme from BootSwatch AND the bootstrap-theme.css file at the same time (unless you actually like the smell of crap).</p>\n\n<p><strong>About Your Own Custom Theme</strong> You might choose to modify bootstrap-theme.css when creating your own theme.

I would have chosen something like <strong>bootstrap-3d.css</strong> or <strong>bootstrap-fancy.css</strong> which would be more descriptive of what it actually does.  What the world sees as a \"Bootstrap Theme\" is a thing you can get from BootSwatch which is a totally different beast.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, the effects are quite nice - gradients and shadows and such.  Unfortunately this file will wreak havoc on BootSwatch Themes, so I decided to dig into what it would take to make it play nice with them.</p>\n\n<h1>LESS</h1>\n\n<p>Bootstrap-theme.css is generated from the <strong>theme.less</strong> file in the Bootstrap source.  The affected elements are (as of Bootstrap v3.2.0):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>List items</li>\n<li>Buttons</li>\n<li>Images</li>\n<li>Dropdowns</li>\n<li>Navbars</li>\n<li>Alerts</li>\n<li>Progress bars</li>\n<li>List Groups</li>\n<li>Panels</li>\n<li>Wells</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The theme.less file depends on:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@import \"variables.less\";\n@import \"mixins.less\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The code uses colors defined in variables.less in several places, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Give the progress background some depth\n.progress {\n    #gradient &gt; .vertical(@start-color: darken(@progress-bg, 4%); @end-color: @progress-bg)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This why bootstrap-theme.css totally messes up BootSwatch Themes.  The good news is that BootSwatch Themes are also created from variables.less files, so you can simply build a bootstrap-theme.css for your BootSwatch Theme.</p>\n\n<h1>Building bootstrap-theme.css</h1>\n\n<p>The right way to do it is to update the Theme build process, but here here is the quick and dirty way.  Replace the variables.less file in the Bootstrap source with the one from your Bootswatch Theme and build it and voila you have a bootstrap-theme.css file for your Bootswatch Theme.</p>\n\n<h1>Building Bootstrap itself</h1>\n\n<p>Building Bootstrap may sound daunting, but it is actually very simple:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download the Bootstrap source code</li>\n<li>Download and install NodeJS</li>\n<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the bootstrap source folder.  Type \"npm install\".  This will add the \"node_modules\" folder to the project and download all the Node stuff you need.</li>\n<li>Install grunt globally (the -g option) by typing \"npm install -g grunt-cli\"</li>\n<li>Rename the \"dist\" folder to \"dist-orig\" then rebuild it by typing \"grunt dist\".  Now check that there is a new \"dist\" folder which contains all you need to use your custom Bootstrap build.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Done.  See, that was easy, wasn't it?</p>\n",

If you want an absolutely-positioned element to appear on the right side of the screen, you can use <code>position: absolute; right: 0;</code>, but this will cause the element to always appear on the right edge of the screen regardless of how wide its parent <code>div</code> is (so it won't be \"at the right of its parent div\").</p>\n",

                    "body": "<p>Tables vs. Divs is a pointless holy war.</p>\n\n<p>There are specific issues with using tables in particular ways for layout that can cause problems. One of these is building an entire site layout in a single table in order to handle margins and placement -- because of the way tables are rendered this frequently means a website will not render progressively by the browser engine as the content downloads, and can only be rendered after the entire thing has been received. For a large page or slow modem user, they may be staring at a blank page for quite a while, which is a \"Bad Thing\". Never mind a lot of the inconsistencies in table rendering in the mozilla/ie5 generation of browsers that made consistent cross-browser table layouts somewhat painful, especially with images in the cells.</p>\n\n<p>Supporters of the pure div path like to talk about content vs. presentation, because in theory HTML 4.01 is pure content, all of it meaningful. The divs provide meaningful organizational structure in an abstract sense, which is then given presentation exclusively by CSS. In these arguments, tables are valid only if being used to contain actual tabular data. Of course, this ignores the fact that for any sufficiently complex layout, there are almost always quite a few empty divs floating around simply to support the necessary hooks for presentation CSS, breaking the first level of this abstraction. Once this abstraction is broken, there's no law stating that, when your layout simply requires a presentation hook in the HTML that has no meaningful content, a div is somehow more appropriate than a table. If you are stuck with the choice of a meaningless div or a meaningless table in order to make your layout work, choose whichever is easier.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it's about being aware of the limitations in all methods and using the one that is most appropriate. There are many cases where using a table is simply easier than setting up a pointless (i.e. not-content-meaningful) array of divs, and the table rendering limitations don't apply. If the table is small and represents a minor chunk of the interior content, the rendering delay is not relevant.</p>\n",

I declare all my <strong>tag</strong> styles first (<code>html</code>, <code>body</code>, <code>ul</code>, etc.), then all classes and ids, sorted alphabetically.  Additionally, all the styles defined in each class, id, or tag are defined alphabetically as well.  Using this convention makes it easier to track down a particular style.</p>\n\n<p>For formatting, I always compress it as small as possible, but still legible.  I put everything on one line with appropriate white space.  If you have Visual Studio, you can specify this format and have it automatically formatted this way for you (Set Style to <strong>Compact rules</strong> under <em>Tools, Options, Text Editor, CSS, Format</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Naming conventions are extremely subjective here, but the thing to keep in mind is to name your elements as their intended purpose, not their styled meaning.  For example, if you have a company slogan you want to style in a large, red font name the id <code>#slogan</code> instead of <code>#red_bold</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a full example to give you an idea:</p>\n\n<pre><code>body { background-color: #fff; color: #999; font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 76%; padding: 0; margin: 0; }\na { color: #2c5eb4; text-decoration: none; }\na:hover { text-decoration: underline; }\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { color: #f70; font-family: helvetica, verdana, arial, serif; font-weight: bold; margin: 1.2em 0; }\nh1 { font-size: 2.4em; line-height: 1.2em;  margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em; }\nh2 { font-size: 1.7em; }\nh3 { font-size: 1.4em; }\nh4 { font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; }\nh5 { font-size: 1.0em; font-weight: bold; }\nh6 { font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; }\nimg { border: 0; }\nli, ol, ul { font-size: 1.0em; line-height: 1.8em; list-style-position: inside; margin-bottom: 0.1em; margin-left: 0; margin-top: 0.2em; }\n#content { clear: both; margin: 0; margin-top: -4em; }\n#columns { height: 36em; }\n#column1, #column2, #column3, #column4 { border-right: 1px solid #dbdbdb; float: left; width: 18%; margin: 0 0.5em; padding: 0 1em; height: 100%; }\n#column1 { width: 28%; }\n#column1 input { float: right; }\n#column1 label { color: #999; float: left; }\n#column2 a, #column3 a { font-weight: bold; }\n#column4 { border-right: 0; }\n#form { margin: 0 2em; }\n.help_button { float: right; text-align: right; width: 30px; }\n</code></pre>\n",

                    "body": "<p>Files should be modularized, so you can make use of <code>@import</code>s. I typically have a base.css file for base classes (such as typography and colors). Depending on your site structure, it may be advantageous to also have other CSS \"partials\" to reuse throughout user-facing stylesheets. These descendant stylesheets can extend base styles with more granularity as needed (E.g., <code>.warn {color:red;}</code> might get extended by <code>p.warn {font-style:italic;}</code>, or <code>h1.warn {border:5px solid red;}</code>), which is a great design pattern for implementing so-called <a href=\"http://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">object-oriented CSS</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Within the files themselves, I like to alphabetize my selectors and property lists. I have tried maintaining separate lists for different types of selectors (an id list first, then my list of classes, and then my list of element selectors), but I've found this unnecessarily difficult, so I have all selectors in the same alphabetical list. That way I can quickly find the root of all complex selectors or any styles given to a simple selector.</p>\n\n<p>Within complex selectors, I list each selector alphabetically.</p>\n\n<p>If I can't use Sass for some reason, I might imitate its <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html#nesting\" rel=\"nofollow\">nesting</a> pattern (I'm still unsure if this is working out or not), like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@import url('/css/base.css');\n\na {\n  color:#369;\n  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  text-decoration: underscore; }\n  a img {\n    border: 0; }\n\nblockquote, .nav, p {\n  margin-bottom: 10px; }\nblockquote {\n  background: #eee;\n  padding: 10px; }\n\nh1, h2, h3, h4 {\n  font-family: Georgia, serif; }\nh1.warning {\n  border: 5px solid red; }\n\n.nav a {\n  font-size: 150%;\n  padding: 10px; }\n.nav li {\n  display: inline-block; }\n\np.warning {\n  font-style: italic; }\n  p.warning a {\n    background: #fff;\n    border-bottom: 2px solid #000;\n    padding: 5px; }\n  p.warning .keyword {\n    text-decoration: underline; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, you may look for the margin for <code>p</code> and not realize that it's part of the <code>blockquote, .nav, p</code>. This also isn't very \"object-oriented\" design, but it's arguably better than putting strings of classes on virtually every element that requires styling.</p>\n\n<p>So, this approach isn't perfect and doesn't completely free you from sometimes having to find-in-file, but it's the best approach I have developed when I cannot use CSS templating tools for reasons beyond my control. I would love to hear any suggestions on improving this method :)</p>\n",

IE7 however, doesn't like the fact that the anchor tag is 'empty' and therefore doesn't treat it as clickable. So I added this to the anchor tag in css:</p>\n\n<pre><code>background:url(/no-image.jpg);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...which seems to fool IE7 into assuming something is there. IE7 now treats the area as clickable, even if no background image actually exists for the anchor tag.

Faking elliptical radial gradients through css transforms will eventually be unnecesary.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Your problem has the most difficult constraints I've ever encountered, but it is an interesting challenge and it illustrates the limitations of each browsers approach for radial backgrounds, so that's why I decided on trying.</p>\n\n<p>First, the rgba approach is stillborn because the opacity is going to hide some of the noise. It's better to apply semitransparent noise on top of the gradient, you can avoid the extra div by applying multiple background on the same image:</p>\n\n<pre><code>background: url(noise.png)  repeat top left, -webkit-gradient(radial,50% 0,700,50% 0,100,from(#6f2813),to(#B9513D))  transparent;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You may notice the color property at the end of declaration, it looks weird but this how you declare colors when you apply multiple backgrounds.</p>\n\n<p>Second, webkit doesn't support elliptical backgrounds, so the work around to this is squishing the gradient through -webkit-transform and positioning it a bit further up:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-webkit-transform: scale(1, 0.7) translate(0, -350px);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For sanity, the right thing to do would seem be applying circular backgrounds on both FF and webkit and then transform them. However, Firefox's transform doesn't support scaling gradients! So we apply an elliptical background:</p>\n\n<pre><code>background: url(noise.png)  repeat top left, -moz-radial-gradient(50% 0 0deg,ellipse farthest-side,#B9513D,#6f2813) transparent;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But, since Webkit's container is squished, Firefox's gradient is larger! At this point we would think about applying different css rules for the height of the gradient, but since Firefox doesn't scale the gradient, we can apply the same transformation on the elliptical background the get the containers to be of the same height:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-moz-transform: scale(1, 0.7) translate(0, -250px);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And voila! we have an elliptical gradient with noise, that works on both Safari and Firefox!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://duopixel.com/stackoverflow/gradient/\">http://duopixel.com/stackoverflow/gradient/</a><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/I4xEn.png\" alt=\"alt text\"></p>\n",

To quote myself:</p>\n  \n  <p>Logically, a box is measured from border to border. Take a physical box, any box. Put something in it that is distinctly smaller than the box. Ask anyone to measure the width of the box. He'll measure the distance between the sides of the box (the 'borders').

The borders, and not the content, are the visual cues for the user of the site. Nobody is interested in the width of the content.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree, the <code>border-box</code> model makes more sense (at least, it does to me).

For example, if margins, padding, and border were factored into the width, I could assign width values to all my columns without worrying about the number of columns, and any changes I make to their padding and margins.</p>\n\n<p>With W3C's box-model I have to worry about the number of columns I have, and develop something akin to a mathematical formula to calculate the correct width values whe modifying margins and padding. Changing their values would be difficult especially for complex layouts. Consider this small frame-work I wrote:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#content {\nmargin:0 auto 30px auto;\npadding:0 30px 30px 30px;\nwidth:900px;\n}\n    #content .column {\n        float:left;\n        margin:0 20px 20px 20px;\n    }\n    #content .first {\n        margin-left:0;\n    }\n    #content .last {\n        margin-right:0;\n    }   \n        .width_1-4 {                    \n            width:195px;                \n        }                       \n        .width_1-3 {\n            width:273px;                \n        }\n        .width_1-2 {\n            width:430px;\n        }\n        .width_3-4 {\n            width:645px;\n        }\n        .width_1-1 {\n                    width:900px;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The values I assigned here will falter unless there are three columns, and thus margins at <code>0+20+20+20+20+0</code>. It would be difficult to modify padding and margins; my entire widths would have to be recalculated. If column width incorporated padding and margins, all I would need to do is change the width and I have my layout. I'm less criticizing the box-model and more hoping to understand why it's considered better as I'm finding it difficult to work with.</p>\n\n<p>Am I doing this thing wrong? It just seems counter intuitive to use W3C's box-model. Some advice would be really appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n",

This solution impossible since the CSS is inserted after the element content, not after the element itself, but something like it would be ideal. On a site with thousands of required fields, I can move the asterisk in front of the input with one change to one line (<code>:after</code> to <code>:before</code>) or I can move it to the end of the label (<code>.required label:after</code>) or in front of the label, or to a position on the containing box, etc... </p>\n\n<p>This is important not just in case I change my mind about where to place the asterisk everywhere, but also for odd cases where the form layout doesn't allow the asterisk in the standard position.

CSS implementation does not happen through a scripting language (unless, of course, the layout engine itself is written in one).</p>\n\n<p>CSS styles are exposed to scripting languages via the CSSOM, which is not the CSS implementation itself, just a scripting API which you could consider as sort of a CSS equivalent to the DOM for HTML.</p>\n\n<p>jQuery is written in JavaScript, which is then run by the browser's JavaScript implementation. If you use jQuery to apply CSS, then jQuery has to access the DOM and CSSOM, which are again implemented in JavaScript, which the browser has to run.</p>\n\n<p>This is similar to using jQuery selectors versus the native Selectors API. jQuery selectors are implemented in <a href=\"http://sizzlejs.com\">Sizzle</a>, a JavaScript selector library, while <code>document.querySelector()</code> is a DOM method that allows you to use a browser's natively-implemented selector engine directly from a script.</p>\n",

Authors expect scripts to be\n  parsed and executed immediately when the parser reaches a \n  tag. The parsing of the document halts until the script was executed.\n  If the script is external then the resource must be first fetched from\n  the network - this is also done synchronously, the parsing halts until\n  the resource is fetched. This was the model for many years and is also\n  specified in HTML 4 and 5 specifications. Authors could mark the\n  script as \"defer\" and thus it will not halt the document parsing and\n  will execute after it is parsed. HTML5 adds an option to mark the\n  script as asynchronous so it will be parsed and executed by a\n  different thread.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Style sheets</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Style sheets on the other hand have a different model. Conceptually it\n  seems that since style sheets don't change the DOM tree, there is no\n  reason to wait for them and stop the document parsing. There is an\n  issue, though, of scripts asking for style information during the\n  document parsing stage. If the style is not loaded and parsed yet, the\n  script will get wrong answers and apparently this caused lots of\n  problems. It seems to be an edge case but is quite common. Firefox\n  blocks all scripts when there is a style sheet that is still being\n  loaded and parsed. Webkit blocks scripts only when they try to access\n  for certain style properties that may be effected by unloaded style\n  sheets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

For example, setting the <code>color</code> to <code>black</code>, to <code>blue</code>, to <code>red</code>, and back to <code>black</code>.</p>\n\n<p><br>\n<strong>ANSWER UPDATE:</strong>\nI went with the answer from <strong>@lucassp</strong>, this is what I ended up with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function toggleIcon(elem, classname)\n{\n    if($(elem).attr('src')=='img/checkbox_checked.gif')\n    {\n        $(elem).attr('src', 'img/checkbox_unchecked.gif')\n        //$('.'+classname).hide();//this was the old line that I removed\n        $('html &gt; head').append($('&lt;style&gt;.'+classname+' { display:none; }&lt;/style&gt;'));\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        $(elem).attr('src', 'img/checkbox_checked.gif')\n        //$('.'+classname).show();//this was the old line that I removed\n        $('html &gt; head').append($('&lt;style&gt;.'+classname+' { display:block; }&lt;/style&gt;'));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I also want to say that <strong>@Nelson</strong> is probably the most \"correct\", though it would require more work to go into application code that always works fine, and that's not effort I want to spend at the moment.  </p>\n\n<p>If I had to rewrite this (or write something similar) in the future, I would look into <code>detach()</code></p>\n",

I would suggest either the <code>name</code> or <code>id</code> attribute if you really want to identify data within your HTML tags.

These class names mostly came in handy when websites were changing webmasters to aid them in understanding the code. It served its cause well but with the new technologies of this day and age, I think this is slowly dying out - infact, it should be dead.</p>\n\n<p>The question we should ask is, \"Do we need to create a new class for every new innovative design that could pass as a template?\". I do not think so. The markup on a site should do what it is meant for - markup. The class names used in the markup should be descriptive of the content and not its looks. The stylesheets - on the other hand - should be able to select elements on a document based on the information in the markup, and style them.</p>\n\n<p>I want to relate this to the Rails association naming convention. Consider this...  </p>\n\n<pre><code>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n    has_one  :personifyable\n    has_many :personifications, :through =&gt; :personifyable\n    has_many :taggables\n    has_many :tags, :through =&gt; taggables\n    belongs_to :destroyers\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously, this is not a real model; it is something I am using to drive a point. Consider the case of a deeply nested dependency. These names will grow ridiculous - if they aren't already (i.e. in CSS, <code>&lt;div class='mediumwidth floatright centeredtext graytheme master'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> or something of the like)</p>\n\n<p>Now consider the case where you have different principles. Different developers and designers may - if not 'most definitely will' -  have different reasons for using a specific naming convention. How would this affect refactoring time. I will leave that to your imagination. Also, if your business partner notices a new trend with sites themes that attracts traffic - more technically, assume this business partner has performed some experimental A/B testing and come up with some specs - you don't want to change the contents of the whole stack (ie HTML and CSS and possibly JS pages) to implement this new <em>style</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, keep styling hints out of your markup. Unobtrusively interact with the document to style and manipulate it. <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sass</a> gives you a fine way of styling a site while having your CSS mock your markup. <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">jQuery</a> is another awesome UJS library. <a href=\"http://html5.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HTML5</a> gives you methods too that make the markup more flexible and yields more information to CSS and JS.</p>\n",

On a site with many visitors per hour, then the classnames could even simply be something like \"c11\" (yes, I've seen it) instead of meaningful, but looong class names.</p>\n\n<p>...depends also if you perfectly know that when the look and feel will change, then the CODE will change also. (exemple: you redesign a site today in XHTML, but you perfectly know that when you'll re-do the CSS in 2 years, then you'll want the markup to be HTML5, so you will pretty much change the structure anyways...)</p>\n\n<p>...depends also if you're already 3 days late on a delivery.  When you're 3 days late, believe me, classnames like \"nopadding\" starts to appear, as you don't have anymore time to think straight about semantic (neither does your client).</p>\n\n<p>Depends on so many things, I'd say...

I found this nifty framework called OOCSS <a href=\"https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki</a> which helped me alot when I was creating a new layout for my web application and suited my requirements so well. </p>\n\n<p>It is mostly because the definition of basic classes for spacing, headers and text works so well when you have to deal with alot of content. Because you use the same classes everywhere it helps make the layout better and maintainable.</p>\n\n<p>Offcourse this means a element in your html can look like this: <code>&lt;div class=\"unit size1of3 lastUnit\"&gt;</code> But isnt that what HTML is about? Making sure your information is presented properly. </p>\n\n<p>I disagree on the whole redesign point, be honest, when you have to redesign your website most CSS goes out the door anyways. And, by dividing the CSS into proper classes for spacing/heading/text it becomes less likely to have conflicting css rules that mess stuff up like <code>ul li div{}</code> </p>\n\n<p>Offcourse the classes do not describe the contents, but as CSS does not allow class inheritance and you have to support old technology like IE6...does it really matter? And do classnames like animal and duck really make for better html? Id like to think HTML is for the browser and when the browser renders it, thats for humans.  </p>\n",

                    "body": "<p>There are two things that I feel get entirely left out of these discussions all too often. The first is WHY you would want to be all semantic or all not. The keywords are Branding and Skinning. Presentational class names may be justifiable if you work on some internal, departmental websites where branding and skinning will never in a million years get funding. On the other hand, customer facing sites, such as car manufacturers and department stores live in a world where every single new product that gets launched results in an entirely new skin for the website. New colors, new layout, new background images and all of this lead by designers who should be able to make the change purely in css so there's no chance they can break any working php (or what-have-you). There are also branded sites, where you have multiple skins, potentially running on the same site <em>simultaneously</em>. On sites with that requirement, you can't have visual changes impact html or you end up breaking every other brand just to update one of them. In these situations, semantic class names are a necessity.</p>\n\n<p>The second thing that often gets left out is how to combat the problem of repeating groups of properties created by semantic class names, as in:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.content-nav {\n    float: left;\n    margin-right: 10px;\n    background-color: #ccc;\n}\n\n.content-nav .user-photo {\n    float: left;\n    margin-right: 10px;\n    border: solid 1px #000;\n}\n\n.content-nav .user-display-name {\n    float: left;\n    margin-right: 10px;\n    text-decoration: underline;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>People often point this out as a drawback of semantic names, and I think that that's a valid point. On the other hand I would like to point out that there are tools that can help you keep semantic css DRY, such as LESS and SASS. I did see one other commenter mention this above, but I just thought that this point was worth highlighting.</p>\n",

            "body": "<p>Lots of websites use class names like <code>floatleft</code>, <code>clearfloat</code>, <code>alignright</code>, <code>small</code>, <code>center</code> etc that describe the style that is attached to the class. This seems to make sense so when writing new content you can easily wrap (for example) <code>&lt;div class=\"clearfloat\"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code> around your element to make it behave the way you want.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, doesn't this style of naming classes go against the idea of separating content from presentation? Putting <code>class=\"floatleft\"</code> on an element is clearly putting presentation information into the HTML document.</p>\n\n<p>Should class names like this that directly describe the attached style be avoided, and if so what alternative is there?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To clarify, this isn't just a question of what to name classes. For example a semantically accurate document might look something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"foo\"&gt;Some info about foo&lt;/div&gt;\n...\n&lt;div class=\"bar\"&gt;Info about unrelated topic bar&lt;/div&gt;\n...\n&lt;div class=\"foobar\"&gt;Another unrelated topic&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Say all these divs need to clear floats, the css would look something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>div.foo, div.bar, div.foobar {\n    clear:both;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This starts to get ugly as the number of these clearing elements increases - whereas  a single <code>class=\"clearfloat\"</code> would serve the same purpose. Is it recommended to group elements based on the attached styles to avoid repetition in the CSS, even if this means presentational information creeps into the HTML?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Thanks for all the answers. The general consensus seems to be to avoid these class names in favour of semantic names, or at least use them sparingly provided they don't hinder maintenance. I think the important thing is that changes in the layout should not require excessive changes to the markup (although a few people said minor changes are okay if it makes overall maintenance easier). Thanks to those who suggested other methods to keep CSS code smaller as well.</p>\n",

Just before that object there is a configuration tag:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;span id=\"skype_highlighting_settings\" display=\"none\" autoextractnumbers=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is added dynamically by the plugin! but here the solution become obvious, to finalle stop skype messing with your design and avoid changing phone number the solution is to insert very early in the document the following tag:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;span id=\"skype_highlighting_settings\" display=\"none\" autoextractnumbers=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>notice the autoextractnumbers=\"0\", here is the trick.

Enjoy your webpages free from messy plugins! And your web page will still validate correctly. Hope it works for you too!

                    "body": "<p>When dealing with performance of pages, there are a few important methods to keeping your page load times quick.</p>\n\n<h2>CSS Organization</h2>\n\n<p>Try to minimize inline CSS styles and keep commonly used CSS rules together in external stylesheets. This helps keep reusable styles for later, and the lack of style attributes makes your HTML page download faster.</p>\n\n<h2>Minification</h2>\n\n<p>Since your CSS and Javascript includes have to be downloaded from your server to the client, smaller is always better. Yahoo has a great tool called <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/\">YUI Compressor</a> which can be used to reduce the size of your CSS and JavaScript includes. Popular libraries such as JQuery will also have both minified and development versions of their libraries available. Just remember to keep a copy of the non-minified version for debugging purposes!</p>\n\n<h2>Image Compression</h2>\n\n<p>You may want to consider compressing your images. For JPG files, try setting around 80% compression, and seeing how the result looks. You can play around with the levels until you get a decent result. For PNG files, you may want to look at some of the <a href=\"http://www.olegkikin.com/png_optimizers/\">PNG compression tools available</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>CSS Sprites</h2>\n\n<p>An interesting tactic in saving HTTP requests is the usage of CSS Sprites. The basic theory is instead of downloading multiple images, you simply download one large image with all of your images contained within it. This means instead of making continuous requests for image files, the browser just needs to make a single request. The tutorial <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/\">CSS Sprites: What They Are, Why They\u2019re Cool, and How To Use Them</a> has some good information on the process, including how to convert from an existing multi-image layout.</p>\n\n<h2>Resource Ordering</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to ordering your CSS and Javascript, you want your CSS to come first. The reason is that the rendering thread has all the style information it needs to rendering the page. If the Javascript includes come first, the Javascript engine has to parse it all before continuing on to the next set of resources. This means the rendering thread can't completely show the page, since it doesn't have all the styles it needs. Here is an example:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/css/global.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/css/forms.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/formvalidation.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Tracking / Affiliate Script Locations</h2>\n\n<p>Many sites utilize tracking and/or affiliate scripts. If there is an issue with the remote host, and the scripts are included in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag, the browser has to wait for the downloads to occur before moving along. While such things are nice to have, they shouldn't slow down the user experience. It is recommended to move such scripts towards the bottom of the page, just before the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;!-- HTML Here --&gt;\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\nvar gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\");\ndocument.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\"));\n&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Missing Assets</h2>\n\n<p>Missing CSS and javascript files means the browser has to needlessly communicate with the server to grab files that don't exist. Depending on where the server is and how many files are missing, that could add up to slower page loads.</p>\n",

There are three main computing platforms that each have their own set of base fonts. Then, some software like Adobe Creative Suite, the Microsoft Office suite, or even software as simple as the Powerpoint 2007 viewer for XP install fonts for the user. There's lot of charts on the web that list <a href=\"http://www.codestyle.org/css/font-family/sampler-CombinedResults.shtml\">commonly used fonts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For a website, you're going to want to use legible fonts. Most of the screen fonts commonly used on the web are pretty legible. The fonts you mention for instance are good examples. The most legible on screen font is Verdana, although it's generally considered to be ugly. Arial is always a safe choice.</p>\n\n<p>Just be careful with that Segoe UI declaration though: if a Windows XP user has that font, it probably won't be legible with anti aliasing disabled.</p>\n\n<p>For headings, you can go custom and use techniques like sIFR and Cufon to replace the text with non-native system fonts.</p>\n\n<p>A quick note on size: most sites tend to set a really small font size. 13 pixels really is the minimum for long texts (see <a href=\"http://www.wilsonminer.com/posts/2008/oct/20/relative-readability/\">relative readibility</a>). A font with a small x-height like Times should only be used for headings or in a large enough size (e.g. 15+ pixels).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>2) Any way to specify with CSS different font sizes for each\n  particular font-familiy? Like 'Segoe\n  UI - 9px', Tahoma - 8px etc. This is\n  probably not possible, but maybe there\n  are some tricks?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, this is not possible. You can make assumptions about the browser and OS people are running via Javascript and thus make assumptions about the fonts they have installed, but it's a lot of work for a relatively small gain. I would advise against it.</p>\n",

Annoying since I set a bounty, but whatever.\nI'm fairly certain this is not a bug and it is expected behavior - especially since we've seen a few more iterations of Chrome and it's stayed the same. \nA few different methods work. I wrote up a bit for my blog, you can see the full article <a href=\"http://thomasshields.net/article/3\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, but here's the bulk of it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>First, I tried the <code>-webkit-text-stroke:1px #000</code> where <code>#000</code> is the\n  color of the text. But this style is meant for use where the color of\n  the text is different from the stroke, for a nice text-outline. When\n  both are the same color, it looks...odd. I'm not sure why; I'm no\n  font-rendering expert. You can see the behavior in the picture after\n  the article.</p>\n  \n  <p>Next I tried a simple <code>text-shadow:#000 0 0 1px</code> where <code>#000</code> is the same\n  color as the text. Due to the same Chrome 14.0.833+ problem, this\n  still leaves the font looking somewhat jagged. It's better than just\n  plain text, however.</p>\n  \n  <p>Next I tried a combined the two attempts above. This looks a little\n  bit better, but it bulks up the text as it essentially adds 2 pixels\n  to the thinkness of the text.</p>\n  \n  <p>Lastly, I tried applying two text-shadows: <code>text-shadow:#000 0 1px 1px,#000 0 -1px 1px</code> >  > where <code>#000</code> is the color of the text. What this does is\n  apply two text shadows, one of which is pushed down a little and the\n  other pushed up. This way, the text shadow covers the jagged edges. It\n  bulks up the text a little but definitely smooths it out.</p>\n  \n  <p>Depending on the size of your text, different methods work. Smaller\n  (but still jagged) text could use the text-shadow, larger text could\n  use the shadow/stroke method, and very large text could use the\n  dual-shadow method. Of course the larger the text the less noticeable\n  the extra few pixels become.

Basically I've just set the text-shadow of a container's text to the container's background. You can see the behavior by setting <code>text-shadow</code> on a largish font element in anything lower than Chrome 14.0.833. The text looks smooth. Remove the text-shadow and the font looks jagged.\nHowever, in Chrome 14.0.833 (UPDATE: appears it's also \"broken\" in 14.0.834) this no longer works. The text-shadow property still works, but not in the way it did before. You can see the behavior <a href=\"http://jsbin.com/ayepuq/edit#preview\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> (just load it up with diff. Chrome versions)\nIt seems as if in the older Chromes the text shadow began inside the text just a little and then spread out - which is perhaps why the text-shadow hack worked. In the newer Chrome, it appears the text shadow starts just <em>outside</em> the text, which is why it won't work. See what I mean <a href=\"http://jsbin.com/ayepuq/3/edit#preview\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>My question is basically: <strong><em>Is this a bug? Which is expected behavior, if either? Are there any other font smoothing workarounds I can use?</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>The W3C's <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#text-shadow\" rel=\"nofollow\">spec</a> didn't seem to say what the intended behavior is, though I did see that perhaps I should be using text-outline (which is kinda unsupported, which defeats the purpose)</p>\n",

Some browsers are smart enough to recognize when an image is inside of a hidden object or in an object of 0 width/height and not load it since it's essentially invisible, anyway. For this reason many people will suggest putting an image in a 1x1 pixel &lt;span&gt; if you want the image to be pre-loaded but not visible.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't require the &lt;img&gt; tag, most browsers won't load images referenced by CSS until the element in question becomes visible.</p>\n\n<p>Mind you that short of using AJAX to download the image there's no way to be 100% sure the browser won't pre-load the image anyway.

Saving the generated image to a server is an infinitely more complex task as it will require an AJAX call or somesuch to send the image data to a PHP script that converts the generated <code>data:</code> URL to an actual image and then saves it to a directory that you have permission to write to. If that's what you need to do, rather than going into that here I'd recommend starting with this Stack Overflow question: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13198131/how-to-save-a-html5-canvas-as-image-on-a-server\">How to save a HTML5 Canvas as Image on a server</a></p>\n",

There's an existing question which touches on this topic:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1442542/how-can-i-get-default-font-size-in-pixels-by-using-javascript-or-jquery\">How can i get default font size in pixels by using JavaScript or JQuery?</a></p>\n\n<p>This question is asking about getting the <em>default font size</em> - which is necessary in order to convert a relative <code>em</code> value to an exact <code>px</code> value.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/4530334/168288\">This answer</a> has a pretty good explanation of how to go about getting the default font size of an element:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since ems measure width you can always compute the exact pixel font\n  size by creating a div that is 1000 ems long and dividing its\n  client-Width property by 1000. I seem to recall ems are truncated to\n  the nearest thousandth, so you need 1000 ems to avoid an erroneous\n  truncation of the pixel result.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, using this answer as a guide, I wrote the following function to get the default font size:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function getDefaultFontSize(parentElement)\n{\n    parentElement = parentElement || document.body;\n    var div = document.createElement('div');\n    div.style.width = \"1000em\";\n    parentElement.appendChild(div);\n    var pixels = div.offsetWidth / 1000;\n    parentElement.removeChild(div);\n    return pixels;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once you have the default font size, you can convert any <code>em</code> width to <code>px</code> width by just multiplying the ems by the element's default font size and rounding the result:</p>\n\n<p><code>Math.round(ems * getDefaultFontSize(element.parentNode))</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> The <code>getDefaultFontSize</code> is ideally supposed to be a simple, side-effect free function that returns the default font size.  But it <em>DOES</em> have an unfortunate side effect: it modifies the DOM!  It appends a child and then removes the child. Appending the child is necessary in order to get a valid <code>offsetWidth</code> property.  If you don't append the child <code>div</code> to the DOM, the <code>offsetWidth</code> property remains at 0 because the element is never rendered.  Even though we immediately remove the child element, this function can still create unintended side effects, such as firing an event (like Internet Explorer's <code>onpropertychange</code> or W3C's <code>DOMSubtreeModified</code> event) that was listening on the parent element. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there any way to write a truly side-effect free <code>getDefaultFontSize()</code> function that won't accidentally fire event handlers or cause other unintended side effects?</p>\n",

When you set your user defined <code>.css</code> this way - AFTER the usual inherit line - it will have the higher priority in cascading one rule than the same rule, defined at standard gwt stylesheets.\nIt took a couple of hours to figure out how to inherit it properly, cause in first try just simply typing <code>&lt;stylesheet src='WebTerminal.css' /&amp;gt</code>; in my <code>.gwt.xml</code> file and commenting out <code>&lt;link type=\"text/css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"WebTerminal.css\"&gt;</code> in my <code>.html</code> host page didn't bring me any result.\nSo, the solution is to use relative path, when you set your <code>.css</code> in <code>.gwt.xml</code> config, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;stylesheet src='../WebTerminal.css' /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice <code>../</code> in the beginning of my relative path. To figure out how it works, add <code>Window.alert(GWT.getModuleBaseURL());</code> as the first line of your <code>onModuleLoad()</code> method. It will show you something like <code>https://localhost:8080/myproject/resouces/webtermial/</code>, when in fact your hosted page URL would look like <code>https://localhost:8080/myproject/resouces/WebTerminal.html</code>.\nHere myproject/resouces is a directory, that contains your <code>.css</code> file, and when you set it in <code>.gwt.xml</code> like <code>&lt;stylesheet src='WebTerminal.css' /&gt;</code>, the compiler starts looking for <code>myproject/resouces/webtermial/WebTerminal.css</code> and can't find it. That's why adding <code>../</code> sometimes is the only thing to do to solve your problem.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the words said above I only want to mention that I was not successful in attempt to find any description of this matter in the latest documentary or throughout the discussions taking place at google groups. Wish it was less harder to figure out, because GWT has much more really complex problems itself, than one, which must have had an exhausted description inside tutorial.</p>\n",

I found only BeeCSS - CSS Generator to be doing an AWESOME job at this! Since then, I have bookmarked both the BeeCSS CSS Generator &amp; BeeCSS Cleaner Minifier &amp; use them in all my projects. I highly recommend them both.</p>\n\n<p>Out of my experience, I have this solution for you. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Simply copy your HTML to a new HTML page &amp; save it. Then upload this HTML page at <a href=\"http://beecss.theextremewebdesigns.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://beecss.theextremewebdesigns.com/</a>.

So if they had redundant styles in the CSS files, you can get rid of them easily this way. </p></li>\n<li><p>Then simply search for the classes &amp; selectors that BeeCSS generated in your original CSS file &amp; copy those styles over to the new CSS generated by BeeCSS. This way, you will make sure that your CSS will now have only the styles that are being used by the HTML document.</p></li>\n<li><p>After all the copy &amp; paste that you have done in the above step, you will find that the appearance of the styles in the CSS may be messy. DONT start to manually clean them. I mean, don't try to fix the tabs, spaces, etc. Simply copy all the styles as they are into BeeCSS - Cleaner Minifier at <a href=\"http://beecss.theextremewebdesigns.com/css_clean_css_minify/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://beecss.theextremewebdesigns.com/css_clean_css_minify/</a> &amp; then hit the \"Clean CSS\" button. That should give you the final result. It will contain only the selectors &amp; classes that were actually used in the HTML document. If you want to reduce the size of the CSS, simply generate the minified version of your \"New\" css by copying the styles over in the BeeCSS Cleaner Miniifer &amp; hit the \"Minify CSS\" button. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The above are the steps that I follow when I work on my projects &amp; they work absolutely great for me. The awesomeness of BeeCSS lies in the fact that both the CSS Generator &amp; Cleaner Minifier are totally free &amp; easy to use &amp; you can generate/clean CSS online within few seconds. You don't need to install any extensions, apps, etc. So you won't be loading your browser with clumsy extensions nor you would need to wait for hours to finish up the process. You will be done in seconds if you follow my instructions ( except for the styles copying part )</p>\n\n<p>Hope that helps.</p>\n",

The browser reads the HTML tags as a stream, and applies what rules it can to the elements it has seen so far. (Obviously this is a simplification.)</p>\n\n<p>An interesting related Q&amp;A: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4656975/use-css-selectors-to-collect-html-elements-from-a-streaming-parser-e-g-sax-stre\">Use CSS selectors to collect HTML elements from a streaming parser (e.g. SAX stream)</a> <s>(a diversion while I search for the article I have in mind).</s></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Ah, here it is: <a href=\"http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/css-parent-selectors\">Why we don't have a parent selector</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We often think of our pages as these full and complete documents full of elements and content. However, browsers are designed to handle documents like a stream. They begin to receive the document from the server and can render the document before it has completely downloaded. Each node is evaluated and rendered to the viewport as it is received.</p>\n  \n  <p>Take a look at the body of an example document:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;\n   &lt;div id=\"content\"&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"module intro\"&gt;\n         &lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"module\"&gt;\n         &lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum&lt;/p&gt;\n         &lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum&lt;/p&gt;\n         &lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum &lt;span&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>The browser starts at the top and sees a <code>body</code> element. At this point,\n  it thinks it's empty. It hasn't evaluated anything else. The browser\n  will determine what the computed styles are and apply them to the\n  element. What is the font, the color, the line height? After it\n  figures this out, it paints it to the screen.</p>\n  \n  <p>Next, it sees a <code>div</code> element with an ID of <code>content</code>. Again, at this\n  point, it thinks it's empty. It hasn't evaluated anything else. The\n  browser figures out the styles and then the <code>div</code> gets painted. The\n  browser will determine if it needs to repaint the body\u2014did the element\n  get wider or taller? (I suspect there are other considerations but\n  width and height changes are the most common effects child elements\n  have on their parents.)</p>\n  \n  <p>This process continues on until it reaches the end of the document.</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTnIxIA5KGw\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/pc7vG.png\"/></a></p>\n  \n  <h3>CSS gets evaluated from right to left.</h3>\n  \n  <p>To determine whether a CSS rule applies to a particular element, it\n  starts from the right of the rule and works it's way left.</p>\n  \n  <p>If you have a rule like <code>body div#content p { color: #003366; }</code> then\n  for every element\u2014as it gets rendered to the page\u2014it'll first ask if\n  it's a paragraph element. If it is, it'll work its way up the DOM and\n  ask if it's a <code>div</code> with an ID of content. If it finds what it's looking\n  for, it'll continue its way up the DOM until it reaches the <code>body</code>.</p>\n  \n  <p>By working right to left, the browser can determine whether a rule\n  applies to this particular element that it is trying to paint to the\n  viewport much faster. To determine which rule is more or less\n  performant, you need to figure out how many nodes need to be evaluated\n  to determine whether a style can be applied to an element.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So why was the stylesheet content not applied progressively (green first, then red)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I <em>think</em> the answer is that external stylesheets are <em>parsed</em> as they are downloaded, but not <em>applied</em> until the entire stylesheet has been parsed. Surely, in parsing a stylesheet, the browser optimizes away unnecessary and redundant CSS rules.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have any proof to back that up right now, but that explanation sounds reasonable to me and agrees with what you're seeing, both with external and inline styles.</p>\n",

To quote the Google article linked below:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As the browser parses HTML, it constructs an internal document tree representing all the elements to be displayed.

                    "body": "<p>One has to decide if this is a question of appearance or of transformation.  One must also decide if this is a question involving character-level semantics or numeral representations.  Here are my thoughts:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The question would have entirely different semantics, if we had a situation where Unicode had not sparated out the codes for numeric characters.\nThen, displaying the different glyphs as appropriate would simply be a matter of using the appropriate font.  On the other hand, it would not have been possible to simply write out the different characters as I did below without changing fonts. (The situation is not exactly perfect as fonts do not necessarily cover the whole range of the 16-bit Unicode set, let alone the 32-bit Unicode set.)</p>\n\n<pre><code>9, \u0669 (Arabic), \u06f9 (Urdu), &amp;#29590; (Chinese, complex), \u0e59 (Thai), \u0bef (Tamil) etc.  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, assuming we accept Unicode semantics i.e. that  '9' ,'\u0669', and '\u06f9' are <em>distinct</em> characters,   we may conclude that the question is not about appearance (something that would have been in the purview of CSS), but of transformation -- a few thoughts about this later, for now let us assume this is the case. \nWhen focusing on character-level semantics, the situation is not too dissimilar with what happens with alphabets and letters.  For instance, Greek '\u03b1' and Latin 'a' are considered distinct, even though the Latin alphabet is nearly identical to the Greek alphabet used in Euboea. Perhaps even more dramatically, the corresponding capital variants, '\u0391' (Greek) and 'A' (Latin) are visually identical in practically all fonts supporting both scripts, yet distinct as far as Unicode is concerned.  </p>\n\n<p>Having stated the ground rules, let us see how the question can be answered by ignoring them, and in particular ignoring (character-level) Unicode semantics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(Horrible, nasty and non-backwards compatible) Solution:</strong>   Use fonts that map '0' to '9' to the desired glyphs.  I am not aware of any such fonts.  You would have to use @font-face and some font that has been appropriately hacked to do what you want.  </p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, I am not particularly fond of this solution.  However, it is the only simple solution I am aware of that does what the question asks \"without changing character codes\" on either the server or the client side.  (Technically speaking the Cufon solution I propose below does not change the character codes either, but what it does, drawing text into canvases is vastly more complex and also requires tweaking open-source code).   </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>  Any transformational solution i.e. any solution that changes the DOM and replaces characters in the range '0' to '9' to, say, their Arabic equivalents will break code that expects numerals to appear in their original form in the DOM.  This problem is, of course,  worst when discussing forms and inputs.</p>\n\n<p>An example of an answer taking the transformational approach is would be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  $(\"[lang='fa']\").find(\"*\").andSelf().contents().each(function() {\n      if (this.nodeType === 3) \n     {\n        this.nodeValue = this.nodeValue.replace(/\\d/g, function(v) {\n            return String.fromCharCode(v.charCodeAt(0) + 0x0630);\n       });\n    }\n });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note:    Code taken from  VisioN's second jsFiddle.  If this is the only part of this answer that you like, make sure you upvote VisioN's answer, not mine!!! :-)</p>\n\n<p>This has two problems:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It messes with the DOM and as a result may break code that used to work assuming it would find numerals in the \"standard\" form (using digits '0' to '9').   See the problem here: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/bKEbR/10/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jsfiddle.net/bKEbR/10/</a>    For instance, if you had a field containing the sum of some integers the user inputs, you might be in for a surprise when you try to get its value...</li>\n<li>It does not address the issue of what goes on inside <code>input</code> (and <code>textarea</code>) elements.  If an input field is initialised with, say, \"42\", it will retail that value.  This can be fixed easily, but then there is the issue of actual input... One may decide to change characters as they come, convert the values when they changes and so on and so forth. If such conversion is made then both the client side and the server side will need to be prepared to deal with different kinds of numeral.  What comes out of the box in Javascript, jQuery and even Globalize (client-side), and ASP.NET, PHP etc. (server-side)  will break if fed with numerals in non-standard formats ...  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A slightly more comprehensive solution (taking care also of input/textarea elements, both their initial values and user input) might be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//before the DOM change, test1 holds a numeral parseInt can understand\nalert(\"Before: test holds the value:\" +parseInt($(\"#test1\").text()));\n\nfunction convertNumChar(c) {\n   return String.fromCharCode(c.charCodeAt(0) + 0x0630);\n}\n\nfunction convertNumStr(s) {\n    return s.replace(/\\d/g, convertNumChar);\n}\n\n//the change in the DOM\n$(\"[lang='fa']\").find(\"*\").andSelf().contents()\n    .each(function() {\n        if (this.nodeType === 3)        \n           this.nodeValue = convertNumStr(this.nodeValue);      \n    })\n    .filter(\"input:text,textarea\")\n    .each(function() {\n         this.value = convertNumStr(this.value)\n     })\n     .change(function () {this.value = convertNumStr(this.value)});      \n\n//test1 now holds a numeral parseInt cannot understand\nalert(\"After: test holds the value:\" +parseInt($(\"#test1\").text()))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The entire jsFiddle can be found here: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/bKEbR/13/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jsfiddle.net/bKEbR/13/</a></p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, this only solves the aforementioned problems partially.  Client-side and/or server-side code will have to recognise the non-standard numerals and convert them appropriately either to the standard format or to their actual values.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a simple matter that a few lines of javascript will solve.  And this is but the simplest case of such possible conversion since there is a simple character-to-character mapping that needs to be applied to go from one form of numeral to the other.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Another go at an appearance-based approach:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cufon-based Solution (Overkill, Non-Backwards Compatible (requires canvas), etc.):</strong>  One could relatively easily tweak a library like Cufon to do what is envisaged.  Cufon can do its thing  and draw glyphs on a canvas object, except that the tweak will ensure that when elements have a certain property, the desired glyphs will be used instead of the ones normally chosen.  Cufon and other libraries of the kind tend to add elements to the DOM and alter the appearance of existing elements but not touch their text, so the problems with the transformational approaches should not apply.  In fact it is interesting to note that while (tweaked) Cufon provides a clearly transformational apprroach as far as the overall DOM is concerned, it is an appearance-based solution  as far as its mentality goes; I would call it a hybrid solution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternative Hybrid-Solution:</strong>  Create new DOM elements with the arabic content, hide the old elements but leave their ids and content intact.  Synchronize the arabic content elements with their corresponding, hidden, elements. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Let's try to think outside the box (the box being current web standards).</p>\n\n<p>The fact that certain characters are unique does not mean they are unrelated.  Moreover, it does not necessarily mean that their difference is one of appearance.  For instance, 'a' and 'A' are the same letter; in some contexts they are considered to be the same and in others to be different.  Having, the distinction in Unicode (and ASCII and ISO-Latin-1 etc. before it) means that some effort is required to overcome it.\nCSS offers a quick and easy way for changing the case of letters.  For instance, <code>body {text-transform:uppercase}</code> would turn all letters in the text in the body of the page into upper case.  Note that this is also a case of appearance-change rather than transformation: the DOM of the body element does not change, just the way it is rendered.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If CSS supported something like <code>numerals-transform: 'ar'</code> that would probably have been the ideal answer to the question as it was phrased.  </p>\n\n<p>However, before we rush to tell the CSS committee to add this feature, we may want to consider what that would mean.  Here, we are tackling a tiny little problem, but they have to deal with the big picture.</p>\n\n<p>Output:\n  Would this numerals-transform feature work allow '10' (2-characters) to appear as &#21313;(Chinese, simple),  &#25342; (Chinese, complex), X (Latin) (all 1-character) and so on if instead of 'ar', the appropriate arguments were given? </p>\n\n<p>Input:\n  Would this numerals-transform feature change '&#21313;'(Chinese, simple) into its Arabic equivalent, or would it simply target '10'?   Would it somehow cleverly detect that \"MMXI\" (Latin numeral for 2012) is a number and not a word and convert it accordingly?</p>\n\n<p>The question of number representation is not as simple as  one might imagine just looking at this question.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So, where does all this leave us:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There is no simple presentation-based solution.   If one appears in the future, it will not be backwards compatible.  </li>\n<li>There can be a transformational \"solution\" here and now, but even if this is made to work also with form elements as I have done (http://jsfiddle.net/bKEbR/13/)  there need  to be server-side and client-side awareness of the non-standard format used. </li>\n<li>There may be complex hybrid solutions.  They are complex but offer some of the advantages of the presentation-based approaches in  some cases.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A CSS solution would be nice, but actually the problem is big and complex when one looks at the big picture which involves other numeric systems (with less trivial conversions from and to the standard system), decimal points,signs etc.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, the solution I see as realistic and backwards compatible would be an extension of Globalize (and server-side equivalents) possibly with some additional code to take care of user input.  The idea is that this is not a problem at the character-level (because once you consider the big picture it is not) and that it will have to be treated in the same way that differences with thousands and decimal separators have been dealt with: as formatting/parsing issues.</p>\n",
