I have my client side and server side code set up..Only I have a few issues. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The call doesn't call new records from that last inserted id it calls from 2 weeks ago</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I've tried many different things and these results are not what I'm looking for.</p>\n\n<p>All I need is for the user logged in to see any new posts made by friends since the last post in there feed. The ajax selects the last ID in the feed which is working great..Sends this through to my PHP. I would like my php to then decide whether or not there is a new post in the database that is a higher id than the current it has sent through. Send it back with JSON and insert it into the feed.\nIf it doesn't have anything at all, to then not post anything..Atm its posting content and there is no new result posted..So its wrong.\nI'm thinking of making the call last for about a minute also to stop extensive calls to my server.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect there is a fair few people on here that have experience with making calls to the server, so can really get down to finding where I've messed up.

You want to avoid doing that as often as you can because it causes an entire reparse of all the HTML in that item every time you add onto it.  This minimizes the number of transactions with the DOM which can be the slowest part of the whole routine.  This improved version cuts the number of DOM transactions a lot.  If <code>jItems.length</code> was <code>20</code> and the average number of videos was 5, this would cut the number of DOM transactions to 1/50th the number of DOM transactions.</li>\n<li>Accumulate string data into an array with <code>.push()</code> and do a <code>.join()</code> at the very end rather than adding onto the end of the string every time.  The JS engine can often join lots of strings at once much more efficiently than joining each segment piecemeal.</li>\n<li>When accumulating string data into arrays, there is no longer a need to initialize the temporaries on each loop or sub-loop.</li>\n<li>Rather than get <code>pList</code> and then have four references to <code>pList.name</code>, just get the name value once and use it directly.</li>\n<li>Cache <code>jItems[i]</code> in the loop because it's referenced several places rather than recalculating it every time.</li>\n<li>Calculate the len variable for each <code>for</code> loop just once and compare to that rather than recalculating it on every iteration.</li>\n<li>Cache <code>jItems[i][\"videos\"]</code> once in the outer loop rather than redoing it every time in the inner loop.</li>\n<li>If there are a large number of items in <code>jsonData.items</code>, then the sort algorithm isn't very efficient since it has to recalculate a lowercase version of each name for every comparison.  You could prebuild all the lowercase versions in one pass (once per item) and then just use them in the sort algorithm rather than have to redo them every time two items are compared.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These changes result in this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function list_response(jsonData) {\n    \"use strict\";\n    var lists = document.getElementById(\"lists\"), anchors = document.getElementById(\"anchors\"), jItems = jsonData.items;\n    var results = [], anks = [], vList, pListName, item, videoItem;\n    // precache all lower case versions to make sorting faster\n    var i, iLen = jItems.length, j, jLen;\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; iLen; i++) {\n        jItems[i].nameLower = jItems[i].name.toLowerCase();\n    }\n    jItems.sort(function (a, b) {\n        return a.nameLower.localeCompare(b.nameLower);\n    });\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; iLen; i++) {\n        item = jItems[i];                   // cache for use in loops\n        videoItem = item[\"videos\"];      // cache for use in loops\n        pListName = item.name;            // cache for use in multiple places\n        results.push('&lt;span class=\"backtotop\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Back to top&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li class=\"title nodot\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"pHeader\" name=\"' + pListName + '\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;' + pListName + '&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;');\n        anks.push('&lt;a class=\"pHeader\" href=\"#' + pListName + '\"&gt;' + pListName + '&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; ');\n\n        for (j = 0, jLen = videoItem.length; j &lt; jLen; j++) {\n            vList = videoItem[j];\n            results.push('&lt;li class=\"nodot\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.site.org/videos/Video_Player.page?bctid=' + vList.id + '\"&gt;' + vList.name + '&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;');\n        }\n    }\n    lists.innerHTML += results.join(\"\");\n    anchors.innerHTML += anks.join(\"\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n",

The approach is definitely correct, and the class is getting switched: you can prove this by changing the appropriate CSS and observing the text color changes correctly when you click the shift button:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.mayuscula a.tecla_teclado{\n    text-transform: uppercase;\n    color: green;\n}\n.minuscula a.tecla_teclado{\n    text-transform: lowercase;\n    color: blue;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Furthermore, each <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element's <code>currentStyle.textTransform</code> property is being set correctly, as you can prove using the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a class=\"tecla_teclado\" onclick=\"alert(this.currentStyle.textTransform);\"&gt;Q&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So we conclude it's a rendering bug in IE 8.

I think this one is currently (in 2013) the one which can be compatible with the largest number of browsers, because it doesn't need any CSS3 properties. However, the method will not work on <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/contenteditable\" rel=\"nofollow\">browsers which doesn't support</a> <code>contentdeditable</code>, be careful.</p>\n\n<h1>Solution with a div <code>contenteditable</code></h1>\n\n<p>As proposed by <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/20728196/1433392\">@Getz</a>, you can use a div with <code>contenteditable</code> and then shape it with some div on it. Here is an example, with two blocks which float at the upper left and the upper right of the main div:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wRZYT.png\" alt=\"The result with Firefox 28\"></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, you have to <strong>play a little with the borders</strong> if you want the same result as you requested in your post. The main div has the blue border on every side. Next, red blocks has to be sticked to hide top borders of the main div, and you need to apply border to them only on particular sides (<em>bottom and left</em> for the right block, <em>bottom and right</em> for the left).</p>\n\n<p>After that, you can get the content via Javascript, when the \"<em>Submit</em>\" button is triggered for example. And I think you can also handle the rest of the CSS (<code>font-size</code>, <code>color</code>, etc.) :)</p>\n\n<h1>Full code sample</h1>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>.block_left {\r\n  background-color: red;\r\n  height: 70px;\r\n  width: 100px;\r\n  float: left;\r\n  border-right: 2px solid blue;\r\n  border-bottom: 2px solid blue;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.block_right {\r\n  background-color: red;\r\n  height: 70px;\r\n  width: 100px;\r\n  float: right;\r\n  border-left: 2px solid blue;\r\n  border-bottom: 2px solid blue;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.div2 {\r\n  background-color: white;\r\n  font-size: 1.5em;\r\n  border: 2px solid blue;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.parent {\r\n  height: 300px;\r\n  width: 500px;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;div class=\"parent\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=\"block_left\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=\"block_right\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=\"div2\" contenteditable=\"true\"&gt;\r\n    \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

It basically runs as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Create an 'Animal' class by extending\n// the 'Object' class with our magic method\nvar Animal = Object.extend(Object, {\n    move : function() {alert('moving...');}\n});\n\n// Create a 'Dog' class that extends 'Animal'\nvar Dog = Object.extend(Animal, {\n    bark : function() {alert('woof');}\n});\n\n// Instantiate Lassie\nvar lassie = new Dog();\n\n// She can move and bark!\nlassie.move();\nlassie.bark();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Namespaces</strong></p>\n\n<p>I also agree with Eric Miraglia on sticking to namespaces so the code above should be run within its own context outside the window object, this is critical if you intend your code to run as one of many concurrent frameworks / libraries executing in the browser window. </p>\n\n<p>This means that the only way to the window object is via your own namespace / module object:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Create a namespace / module for your project\nwindow.MyModule = {};\n\n// Commence scope to prevent littering \n// the window object with unwanted variables\n(function() {\n\n    var Animal = window.MyModule.Animal = Object.extend(Object, {\n         move: function() {alert('moving...');}\n    });\n\n    // .. more code\n\n})();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Interfaces</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can also make use of more advances OOP constructs such as interfaces to enhance your application design. <a href=\"http://desalasworks.com/object-oriented-javascript-inheritance/#adding-interfaces\">My approach to these</a> is to enhance the <code>Function.prototype</code> in order to get a notation along these lines:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Dog = Object.extend(Animal, {\n     bark: function() {\n         alert('woof');\n     }\n     // more methods ..\n}).implement(Mammal, Carnivore);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>OO Patterns</strong></p>\n\n<p>As for 'Patters' in the Java sense, I've only found use for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern\">Singleton pattern</a> (great for caching) and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern\">Observer pattern</a> for event-driven functionality such as assigning some actions when a user clicks on a button. </p>\n\n<p>An example of utilising the Observer Pattern would be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Instantiate object\nvar lassie = new Animal('Lassie');\n\n// Register listener\nlassie.on('eat', function(food) {\n   this.food += food;\n});\n\n// Feed lassie by triggering listener\n$('#feeding-button').click(function() {\n    var food = prompt('How many food units should we give lassie?');\n    lassie.trigger('eat', [food]);\n    alert('Lassie has already eaten ' + lassie.food + ' units');\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And thats just a couple of tricks in my bag of OO JS, hope they are useful to you. </p>\n\n<p>I recommend if you intend to go down this road that you read Douglas Crockfords <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742\">Javascript: the Good Parts</a>.

A very good example is openstreetmap.org - (global streets map collected by the community). OSM can be added to openlayers as a TMS layer.

I'm a professional OpenLayers developer and fan, so I'll address your questions from that perspective.</p>\n\n<p><em>Why would I use OpenLayers instead of Google Maps?</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Flexiblity: You are not tied to any particular map provider or technology. You can change anytime and not have to rewrite your entire code. Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, WMS, ArcGIS Server, MapServer, etc. are all supported out of the box.</li>\n<li>Vector Support: Better support for points, polylines, and polygons.</li>\n<li>Control: You have the ability to add any new features that you may need. I've personally written three plugins for OpenLayers, two of which are or will be part of the source.</li>\n<li>Debugging: Much easier to debug when you can step through the source code!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would not worry at all about the long-term viability of the project. It is the premier open source client-side mapping library.</p>\n\n<p><em>Are there any common pitfalls / problems I may encounter?</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The biggest pitfall I've run into is working with the Web Mercator (Google) projection. It can be a pain to display vector data that is in a common and real projection like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#A_new_World_Geodetic_System%3a_WGS_84\">WGS 84</a> into an OpenLayers map using Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft base maps. The examples are your friend.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>JavaScript Framework Compatibility</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I use the jQuery framework for all of my work, and the only problem I've had is referencing jQuery after OpenLayers. Other than that, it's been smooth sailing.</li>\n<li>Performance is great! The only issues will be with your map server or adding too many vectors to your map.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Are there maps available for many places?</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Like I said, you can use basemaps from just about any source for anywhere in the world.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Is there any kind of API to display roads?</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I'd check out CloudMade! The have converted the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap\">OpenStreetMap</a> project into a map tile service and allow custom styling. I believe that you can style one-way streets (per your example) a particular way. <em><a href=\"http://developers.cloudmade.com/projects\">The CloudMade Developer Zone</a></em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Do you know any good tutorial to OpenLayers?</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I don't know any tutorials, but there are a ton of examples in <em><a href=\"http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/\">OpenLayers Examples</a></em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I hope this is useful.

If you're concerned one way or another, consult an attorney. Google is empowering you to make the decision as to how you want to proceed.</p>\n\n<p>They'll leave implementation details to you, but, the idea is, once you've determined whether or not to track the user in Google Analytics, if the answer is to not track, you'd set the following property to true before Google Analytics runs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>window['ga-disable-UA-XXXXXX-Y'] = true;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where UA-XXXXXX-Y is your account ID in Google Analytics</p>\n\n<p>As the other posters have noted, Google Analytics relies on cookies. So, you're not able to do any kind of tracking without cookies. If you've determined that someone is not to be cookied for tracking, you'll need to implement something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if(doNotCookie()){\n   window['ga-disable-UA-XXXXXX-Y'] = true;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Opt In</h1>\n\n<p>This does require a little bit of jujitsu for when you first load Google Analytics, since this property will need to be set <em>before</em> Google Analytics runs to prevent tracking from ever happening, which means, for an \"opt in to tracking\" approach, you'd probably need to implement a mechanism where, on first visit, Google Analytics is automatically disabled in the absence of an opt-in cookie (cookies that determine cookie preferences are explicitly allowed), and then, if an opt-in happens, re-runs Google Analytics. On subsequent pageviews, all would run smoothly. </p>\n\n<p>Could look something like (pseudo-code):</p>\n\n<pre><code>if( hasOptedOut() || hasNotExpressedCookiePreferenceYet() ){ //functions you've defined elsewhere\n     window['ga-disable-UA-XXXXXX-Y'] = true;\n}\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-XXXXXXX-Y']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n\n  function onOptIn(){ //have this run when/if they opt-in.\n      window['ga-disable-UA-XXXXXX-Y'] = false;\n      //...snip...\n      //set a cookie to express that the user has opted-in to tracking, for future pageviews\n      _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']); // now run the pageview that you 'missed'\n   }\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Opt Out</h1>\n\n<p>With this approach, you'd allow the user to opt-out of tracking, which would mean you'd use a cookie to set the <code>ga-disable-UA-XXXXXX-Y'</code> property and a cookie to manage it in the future:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if( hasOptedOut() ){ // function you've defined elsewhere \n     window['ga-disable-UA-XXXXXX-Y'] = true;\n}\n\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-XXXXXX-Y']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n</code></pre>\n",

                    "body": "<p>If you don't mind, I'm going to start with clearing up some wording. REST is not a protocol in itself, it's simply a way of using the HTTP protocol. The REST style is especially useful for APIs, as I hope you'll see. When an API conforms to that style, it is said to be \"RESTful\". If the API you're working with isn't RESTful, you'll have to make a lot of changes to Backbone.sync in order to get it to work. So hopefully it is! :)</p>\n\n<h2>The HTTP Protocol</h2>\n\n<p>I like examples, so here is an HTTP request to get the HTML for this page:</p>\n\n<pre><code>GET /questions/18504235/understand-backbone-js-rest-calls HTTP/1.1\nHost: stackoverflow.com\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>[Optional] If you have ever played with command line or terminal, try running the command <code>telnet stackoverflow.com 80</code> and pasting in the above, followed by pressing enter a couple of times. Voila! HTML in all of it's glory.</p>\n\n<p>In this example...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>GET</code> is the <strong>method</strong>.</li>\n<li><code>/questions/18504235/understand-backbone-js-rest-calls</code> is the <strong>path</strong>.</li>\n<li><code>HTTP/1.1</code> is the <strong>protocol</strong>.</li>\n<li><code>Host: stackoverflow.com</code> is an example of a <strong>header</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your browser does approximately the same, just with more headers, in order to get the HTML for this page. Cool, huh?</p>\n\n<p>Since you work in front end, you've probably seen the form tag many times. Here's an example of one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;form action=\"/login\" method=\"post\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\" value=\"Log In\" /&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When you submit this form along with appropriate data, your browser sends a request that looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>POST /login HTTP/1.1\nHost: stackoverflow.com\n\nusername=testndtv&amp;password=zachrabbitisawesome123&amp;submit=Log%20In\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are three differences between the previous example and this one.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The <strong>method</strong> is now <code>POST</code>.</li>\n<li>The <strong>path</strong> is now <code>/login</code>.</li>\n<li>There is an extra line, called the <strong>body</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>While there are a bunch of other methods, the ones used in RESTful applications are <code>POST</code>, <code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code>, and <code>DELETE</code>. This tells the server what type of action it's supposed to take with the data, without having to have different paths for everything.</p>\n\n<h2>Back to Backbone</h2>\n\n<p>So hopefully now you understand a bit more about how HTTP works. But how does this relate to Backbone? Let's find out!</p>\n\n<p>Here's a small chunk of code you might find in a Backbone application.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var BookModel = Backbone.Model.extend({\n    urlRoot: '/books'\n});\nvar BookCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({\n    model: BookModel\n    , url: '/books'\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Create (POST)</h3>\n\n<p>Since we're using a RESTful API, that's all the information Backbone needs to be able to create, read, update, and delete all of our book information! Let's start by making a new book. The following code should suffice:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var brandNewBook = new BookModel({ title: '1984', author: 'George Orwel' });\nbrandNewBook.save();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Backbone realizes you're trying to <strong>create</strong> a new book, and knows from the information it's been given to make the following request:</p>\n\n<pre><code>POST /books HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n{\"title\":\"1984\",\"author\":\"George Orwel\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Read (GET)</h3>\n\n<p>See how easy that was? But we want to get that information back at some point. Let's say we ran <code>new BookCollection().fetch()</code>. Backbone would understand that you're trying to <strong>read</strong> a <strong>collection</strong> of books, and it would make the following request:</p>\n\n<pre><code>GET /books HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>BAM. That easy. But say we only wanted the information for one book. Let's say book #42. Say we ran <code>new BookModel({ id: 42 }).fetch()</code>. Backbone sees you're trying to <strong>read</strong> a <strong>single</strong> book:</p>\n\n<pre><code>GET /books/42 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Update (PUT)</h3>\n\n<p>Oh darn, I just realized I spelled Mr. Orwell's name wrong. Easy to fix!</p>\n\n<pre><code>brandNewBook.set('author', 'George Orwell');\nbrandNewBook.save();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Backbone is smart enough to know that despite being called <code>brandNewBook</code>, it's already been saved. So it <strong>updates</strong> the book:</p>\n\n<pre><code>PUT /books/84 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n{\"title\":\"1984\",\"author\":\"George Orwell\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Delete (DELETE)</h3>\n\n<p>Finally, you realize that the government is tracking your every move, and you need to bury the fact that you have read 1984. It's probably too late, but it never hurts to try. So you run <code>brandNewBook.destroy()</code>, and Backbone <strike>becomes sentient and realizes your danger</strike> <strong>deletes</strong> the book with the following request:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DELETE /books/84 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And it's gone.</p>\n\n<h2>Other Useful Tidbits</h2>\n\n<p>While we've talked a lot about what we're sending TO the server, we should probably also take a look at what we're getting back. Let's return to our collection of books. If you remember, we made a <code>GET</code> request to <code>/books</code>. In theory, we should get back something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n    {\"id\":42,\"author\":\"Douglas Adams\",\"title\":\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\"}\n    , {\"id\":3,\"author\":\"J. R. R. Tolkien\",\"title\":\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\"}\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Nothing too scary. And even better, Backbone knows how to handle this out of the box. But what if we changed it a bit? Instead of <code>id</code> being the identifying field, it was <code>bookId</code>?</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n    {\"bookId\":42,\"author\":\"Douglas Adams\",\"title\":\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\"}\n    , {\"bookId\":3,\"author\":\"J. R. R. Tolkien\",\"title\":\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\"}\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Backbone gets that every API is a bit different, and it's okay with that. All you have to do is let it know the <code>idAttribute</code>, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var BookModel = Backbone.Model.extend({\n    urlRoot: '/books'\n    , idAttribute: 'bookId'\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You only have to add that information to the model, since the collection checks the model anyway. So just like that, Backbone understands your API! <em>Even if I don't...</em></p>\n\n<p>The downside of this is that you have to remember to use <code>bookId</code> in certain cases. For example, where we previously used <code>new BookModel({ id: 42 }).fetch()</code> to load the data about a single book, we would now have to use <code>new BookModel({ bookId: 42 }).fetch()</code>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Hopefully you've found this response informative, and not too unbearably dull. I realize that for many, HTTP protocol and RESTful architecture aren't the most exhilarating subjects, so I tried to spice it up a bit. I may regret that when I read all of this back at a later point, but it's 2AM here, so I'm gonna go ahead and submit this anyway.</p>\n",

But, I gave up on Fabric for the following reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>weird and undocumented API inconsistencies that burned a lot of my time unnecessarily.</li>\n<li>inconsistent pointer event support. Specifically, Fabric does not consider a \"Path\" to be a true shape object that is selectable and observable.  This did not meet my needs since interactive Paths are a major requirement of my app.</li>\n<li>behind the scenes additions of translations to the Canvas to position objects. For me, Fabric tries to be too clever in this regard without being clear to the developer what it's doing.</li>\n<li>overly strong opinion on how move, resize and rotate interactivity works. In many ways, it's great to have this functionality built into the framework but, in my case, I didn't agree with the way it was implemented which meant essentially having to reimplement it myself anyway.</li>\n<li>sparse documentation - lot's of those cases where the documentation of a method is of the form:  \"setX(Y) - set's the X to Y\" :-)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I took a look at Paper and didn't get too far. It seemed overly obtuse to me and also falls between too stools IMO - it's too much of a visualization library to be a simple object model for Canvas but it's not enough of a visualization library to compete with D3.  Plus, the documentation again was not particularly accessible.</p>\n\n<p>I think Easel probably makes a lot of sense if you have a Flash/ActionScript background but I do not. Plus, it seemed overly game-focused for my requirements. The nail in the coffin was again documentation - not enough and presented in non-standard format.</p>\n\n<p>So, I ended up going with Kinetic because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>really rich and clear tutorials and examples</li>\n<li>API functions do what they're called and are largely guessable - faster productivity, shallower learning curve</li>\n<li>is reasonably clear about what it does do and what it doesn't - it's not as rich as some of the others but that's a benefit; it does fewer things but does them better</li>\n<li>Paths are first-class citizen Shapes, like any other Shape, which was essential for my requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Kinetic is not perfect by any means and there have been a few times when I've had to dive deep into the source code to work out what's actually going on under the covers.

The top answer was Fabric.js. After doing a bit more research I came across <a href=\"http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/\">http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/</a> which features tutorials on KineticJs, that boasts having multiple canvases for speed. A bit more research later revealed that Canvas libraries seem to be all over the place when it comes to speed and features. What is the current state of JavaScript Canvas libraries and frameworks today? Has one come out on top?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Since libraries are ever changing and a lot of people have recently been coming here for news and info on new libraries I changed the question to be more timeless.</p>\n",

There are a few behavioral differences (see below).</li>\n<li>Is built on top of jQuery (and doesn't require <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MooTools\">MooTools</a>, which is a plus over the other serious contender, <a href=\"http://moowmd.awardspace.info/\">mooWMD</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I ended up implementing the functionality which shows/hides the editbox myself, which proved pretty easy for the most part. I <strong>haven't</strong> extended the editor with any buttons, which I'm sure will require some messing around in its source, but I don't think it will be too big a deal.</p>\n\n<h2>Differences from the Stack Overflow version</h2>\n\n<p>There are a few differences from the Stack Overflow editor:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Single enters at the end of lines cause a <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>, instead of being considered one paragraph. I happen to prefer it this way, so I'm fine with this change.</li>\n<li>Numbered lists are auto-numbered, ala Microsoft Word. That is, hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> after writing \"1. first item\" will automatically get you a line that starts with \"2. \". This is also a change I really like.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Well, I hope this helps anyone looking for a similar editor. If I end up customizing the editor, I'll create my own branch (it's licensed under the MIT license), but right now I'm getting away without tinkering with the source code.</p>\n",

After researching this topic for the last few days, I realize there are numerous forks of the base WMD editor, some with a few basic enhancements and some with serious differences from the Stack Overflow one.</p>\n\n<p>Since this will be the heart of the application, I'd like to start with the best code base I can. I'd be happy if anyone can recommend which one of the many solutions out there best fits my needs.</p>\n\n<p>Below are requirements, plus what I've managed to find already. I'm hoping this question will help me decide which version to go with, and maybe help me discover a port that's an even better fit for my needs.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>The requirements for my project</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Live preview</li>\n<li>Multiple editors on the same page (I do not know how many in advance, since the user can dynamically add another editing box).</li>\n<li>Ability to extend with extra buttons (I'd like a button to upload a picture, instead of just adding an <code>img</code> URL).</li>\n<li>Ability to dynamically show/hide the edit box (and only see the preview box).</li>\n<li>Not an absolute must, but I'd prefer to stick as close to Stack Overflow's look and feel, since it's well known.</li>\n<li>Don't know if this matters, but the backend is written in Django.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Editors I've looked at</h2>\n\n<p>Here are a few of the code bases I've looked at, with thoughts. Obviously, I might be missing another solution out there.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://github.com/derobins/wmd\">derobins</a> version. From what I can tell, this is the official Stack Overflow version. Seems like it doesn't support multiple editors on one page.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/tstone/jquery-markedit\">jQuery.MarkEdit</a>. Looks very good, but is pretty different from the Stack Overflow version.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://moowmd.awardspace.info/moowmd-tutorial.html\">MooWMD</a>. Looks like the winner right now, but I'm a little concerned since it looks less active/hackable than MarkEdit.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/wmd-new/\">wmd-new</a> version. Not sure, looks like an old codebase without much use.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://github.com/ananthakumaran/wmd/\">SocialSite branch</a>. Seems like it's not for public use.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Since the release of method chaining in (LINQ) in C# 3.0 this works very well for .NET programmers.  So the flow from one language to the next is easy.  To be able to query the DOM for an object, or a list of objects, works much better for us.  It is jQuery's selection power first that makes it so attractive, then the extendability of it, and of course all the built in features that come with it are nice.  Also, the community behind is wonderful in that I first look to see if someone else did something and then attempt to do it myself if a solution was not found.  And last...but certainly not least...the fact that Microsoft is going to include in in Visual Studio 10 and support it is great.

I'd love to have the time to learn it. But have you looked at Dojo? I had to use it on one project and found that it had pulled in most of the great ideas from jQuery as well.

Learning jQuery is good for their careers, and there are more books, examples, and fellow programmers to ask for help if they use jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>If you decide to go jQuery after all, think hard before deciding whether to tack on an OO library.

Since 95% of the people picking up javascript are doing so just to manipulate the DOM, there's no point in going through the longer MooTools learning curve. MooTools simply doesn't bring anything to the table for them that jQuery doesn't deliver with less effort.</p>\n\n<p>MooTools demands more from you before you use it, jQuery lets you throw something together quickly. If you start writing large, heavy-duty js apps, you might run into some of the drawbacks of that approach, but again 95% of the folks writing js don't do that, so those things don't matter to them. They use a server-side language for the heavy-lifting and javascript for the DOM.</p>\n\n<p>For that matter, they may not matter to your team, either. To take you through the lists, point by point (jQuery first):</p>\n\n<p>Large community of supporters -- only slightly relevant to the project. Of more relevance to the team personally, because it speaks to life after you. If misfortune strikes (please, God, no) and your firm is gone, jQuery gets them more jobs than MooTools.</p>\n\n<p>Plugin Repository -- very relevant, as it helps keep from reinventing the wheel.</p>\n\n<p>Integration with Microsoft's ASP.NET and VisualStudio -- very relevant if you're a .NET shop. In fact, this alone should be the reason to switch if you do .NET.</p>\n\n<p>Used by Microsoft, Google and others -- who cares?</p>\n\n<p>Now for the MooTools list:</p>\n\n<p>Object Oriented Framework with Classic OOP emulation for JS -- irrelevant, unless the nature of your projects makes that a plus. I don't know what you're building, but for web shops, this is only rarely relevant. Most web shops don't have enough code to make this a plus.</p>\n\n<p>Extended native objects -- again irrelevant for most web shops</p>\n\n<p>Higher consistency between browsers for native functions support. -- Relevant</p>\n\n<p>More easy code reuse -- This conflicts a little with the jQuery advantage of a large repository. A large repository by itself speaks to reusing code. I suspect you're using a narrow definition of code reuse, here, that may not be relevant. I've reused a lot of the jQuery code I've built, as well as MT code.</p>\n\n<p>Used by The World Wide Web Consortium, Palm and others. -- Irrelevant. The only relevance about who else is using what is if you're wanting a job there.

Get your bias out of the way, and sit down with your team and get their bias out of the way as well. Talk turkey about the specific types of projects you're undertaking (and want to undertake) and the strengths of each library as applied to those cases.

JQuery at work (adopted because it was \"more widely adopted\") and Mootools on personal projects.

At work, I find myself writing chains 75 events long... and I feel dirty as a result.</p>\n\n<p>My main overall beef with JQuery though, is that there's a lack of consistency or practice where plug-ins and 3rd party developers are concerned.  The anecdotal \"More plug-ins are available\" really doesn't help me when there's no consistency between the plug-ins, structurally or otherwise.  It took  me several weeks to learn the \"accepted\" plug-in model, and even then, I've adapted my own pragmatic style into it, as I find error and inefficiency within the current structures. It can be said that it's a 'Pro' that anyone can jump in and start JQuerying it up.  However, I am more inclined to call that a 'Con', in that you will see 30 different ways to accomplish something, and it's difficult to pin an accepted standard.</p>\n\n<p>So what does it mean to \"Know JQuery\", Does it mean you know how to rock a little .hide().show().fadeIn().fadeOut()?</p>\n\n<p>When I have to get gangster on my JS at work, I miss me some Mootools.

Also check out John Resig's <a href=\"http://ejohn.org/blog/the-dom-is-a-mess/\">The DOM is a Mess</a> presentation at yahoo, which gives a lot of theory about how to deal with cross-browser topics efficiently. </p>\n\n<p>However, if you're interested in simply having them solved, your question is an excellent example of why many consider using client-side libraries like <a href=\"http://www.jquery.com\">jQuery</a>, <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/\">YahooUI</a>, <a href=\"http://mootools.net/\">MooTools</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dojotoolkit.org/\">Dojo</a>, etc. With a thriving community, talented people and corporate backing projects like those allow you to focus on your app rather than these issues.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some jQuery examples that avoid much of the cross-browser frustration and can really make all of this.. fun.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cross-browser mouse click binding</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#select anything + you[want=using] ~ css:selectors').click(\n    function(){ \n       alert('hi');\n    }\n);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Cross-browser HTML Injection</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#anElementWithThisId').html('&lt;span&gt;anything you want&lt;/span&gt;');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Cross-browser Ajax (all request objects are  <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/load\">still made available</a> to you)</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>$('p.message').load('/folder/file.html');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>And what really blows me away, load a data subset with selectors (see <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/load\">manual</a> for details)</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>$('p.message').load('/folder/file.html body p:first-child');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Now, how all this really starts to get fun: chaining methods together</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>$('ul.menu a').click(           // bind click event to all matched objects\n  function(evt){                // stnd event object is the first parameter\n    evt.preventDefault();       // method is cross-browser thx to jquery\n    $(this)                     // this = the clicked 'a' tag, like raw js\n      .addClass('selected')     // add a 'selected' css class to it\n      .closest('ul.menu')       // climb the dom tree back up to the ul\n      .find('a.selected')       // find any existing selected dom children\n      .not(this)                // filter out this element from matches\n      .removeClass('selected'); // remove 'selected' css class\n  }\n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Reminds me of Joel's <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/01.html\">Can Your Programming Language Do This?</a> article.</p>\n\n<p>Taking all this to a theoretical level, true advancement doesn't come from what you can do with conscious thought and effort, but rather what you can do automatically (without thought or effort). Joel has a segment on this in <em>Smart And Gets Things Done</em> regarding interviewing questions and smart developers, completely changed my approach to programming.</p>\n\n<p>Similar to a pianist who can just 'play' the music because she knows all the keys, your advancement comes not from doing more things that require thought but rather more things that require no thought. The goal then becomes making all the basics easy.. natural.. subconscious.. so we can all geek out on our higher level goals.</p>\n\n<p>Client side libraries, in a way, help us do just that. ;)</p>\n",

Problems I personally deal with that have left a memorable impression (in no particular order):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Having to use frameworks to do basic things because each browser implements the DOM a little differently.  This is especially heinous with IE and AJAX, which necessitates multiple if-blocks just to get the call started.  In an ideal world I'd be able to work in JavaScript without the framework to do basic things.</p></li>\n<li><p>onChange on selects in IE are implemented wrong, and fire before the select loses focus (which is incorrect).  This means you can never use onChange with selects due to IE, since keyboard-only users will be crippled by this implementation issue.</p></li>\n<li><p>You mentioned it in your post, but it's a huge pain when IE grabs an element by name when using getElementBy**Id**().</p></li>\n<li><p>When in an RTL locale (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.), Firefox implements \"text-align: right;\" incorrectly.  If the container overflows for some reason, the text aligns to the right side of the viewable container, rather than the right side of the container itself (even if it makes part of it invisible).</p></li>\n<li><p>Different browsers have differing levels of pickiness with regards to how you end arrays and objects.  For example, Firefox is more than okay with an array looking like this: [ item0, item1, ]\".  However, this same code will make Opera barf because it hates the trailing comma.  IE will make the array a three-item array, with the third item undefined!  This is bad code for sure, but there's been dynamically generated javascript I've worked on that was a huge pain to rewrite - would've been nice if this just worked.</p></li>\n<li><p>Everything having to do with IE's <a href=\"http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/onhavinglayout.html\">hasLayout</a>.  So much awful pain has revolved around this attribute, especially when I didn't know it existed.  So many problems fixed by using hacks to add hasLayout.  So many more problems created as a result of the hacks.</p></li>\n<li><p>Floats in IE rarely work the way you hope they do.  They also tend to be annoying in other browsers, but they at least conform to a particular behavior.  ;)</p></li>\n<li><p>IE adding <a href=\"http://www.brunildo.org/test/IEWlispace.php\">extra white space between list items</a> has caused me no end of pain, since YUI uses lists to make their menus.  (To fully grasp the issue, you have to view that link in IE and another browser side by side.)</p></li>\n<li><p>I have lots of issues getting text not to wrap in containers in IE.  Other browsers listen to \"white-space: nowrap\" a lot better.  This has been a problem with a UI I worked on that has a resizable sidebar; in IE, the sidebar items will start to wrap if you resize it too much.</p></li>\n<li><p>The lack of many CSS selector types in IE6 means you have to class-up your DOM more than necessary.  For example, the lack of +, :hover, :first-child.</p></li>\n<li><p>Different browsers treat empty text nodes differently.  Specifically, when traversing the DOM with Opera, I have to worry about empty text nodes when browsing a node's children.  This isn't a problem if you're looking for a particular item, but it is if you're writing code that expects a particular input and the way the browser views that input differs.</p></li>\n<li><p>In IE6, when you dynamically generate an iframe via javascript, the iframe sometimes doesn't fill its container automatically (even with width and height set to max).  I still don't know how to solve this issue, and have been thinking of posting a question about it.</p></li>\n<li><p>In IE, you can't set overflow CSS on the &lt;tbody> element.  This means that scrollable tables (with a concrete &lt;thead> and &lt;tfoot>) are impossible to make in a simple manner.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I will probably add more to this list later, since (to me) the worst part of web development are cross-browser issues.  Also, I doubt I'll ever edit out the \"I will probably add more to this list later\", since these problems are endless.  :)</p>\n",

Doesn't seem to work in Internet Explorer, and possibly some versions of Opera. </p>\n\n<p>If I were to implement a favicon data URI, I'd do it as such: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>include an IE conditional comment that would load the actual favicon.ico in the traditional way, since it seems that Internet Explorer doesn't support Data URI Favicons</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;!--[if IE ]&gt;&lt;link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"http://example.com/favicon.ico\"  type=\"image/x-icon\" /&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;</code></p></li>\n<li><p>Include the favicon.ico file in your root directory to cover browsers that will request it either way, since for those browsers, if they're already checking no matter what you do, you might as well not waste the HTTP request with a 404 response. </p></li>\n<li><p>Use feature detection to <a href=\"http://weston.ruter.net/2009/05/07/detecting-support-for-data-uris/\">detect Data URI support</a>, and inject the favicon dynamically for non-IE browsers that don't support Data URIs:</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;!--[if !(IE)]&gt;&lt;!--&gt;&lt;script&gt;(function(){\nvar d = new Image();\nd.onload = data.onerror = function(){\n    if(this.width != 1 || this.height != 1)\n        //inject favicon here\n};\nd.src = \"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAQABAAACAUwAOw==\";\n})();&lt;/script&gt; &lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;</code></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Another possibility is you could remove the regular favicon code and then just <a href=\"http://yahelc.com/favicon-ondomready.html\">inject the favicon</a> at DOM Ready (example using jQuery):</p>\n\n<pre><code>   jQuery(function($){\n    $('&lt;link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"http://example.com/favicon.ico\"  type=\"image/x-icon\" /&gt;').appendTo('head');\n   });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That way, your whole page will load before making the <code>favicon</code> request in browsers that do not make the request automatically on their own.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't care about actually having a favicon, you could (as a commenter points out) just include your blank.gif pixel as your favicon, and use the opportunity to pre-load it, so that subsequent usage would be served from the cache. You could also just use the favicon of another popular site which is likely to have their favicon cached, like <code>http://google.com/favicon.ico</code>, so that it is served from cache. </p>\n\n<p>As commenters have pointed out, just because you <em>can</em> do this doesn't mean you should, since some browsers will request favicon.ico regardless of the tricks we devise. The amount of overhead you'd save by doing this would be minuscule compared to the savings you'd get from doing things like gzipping, using far-future expires headers for static content, minifying JavaScript files, putting background images into sprites or data URIs, serving static files off of a CDN, etc. </p>\n",

You have no way of knowing for sure. Could be an integer - could be a float - could be a string. In that sense it's very much \"untyped\" data. </p>\n\n<p>If I give you an imaginary language which lets you use operators like \"add\", \"subtract\", and \"concatenate\" on this data and some other arbitrary piece of data the \"type\" is somewhat irrelevant (to my imaginary language) (example: perhaps <code>add(12, a)</code> yields <code>109</code> which is <code>12</code> plus the ascii value of <code>a</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Let's talk C for a second. C pretty much lets you do whatever you want with any arbitrary piece of data. If you're using a function that takes two <code>uint</code>s - you could cast and pass anything you want - and the values will simply be interpreted as <code>uint</code>s. In that sense C is \"untyped\" (if you treat it in such a way).</p>\n\n<p>However - and getting to Brendan's point - if I told you that \"My age is <code>12</code>\" - then <code>12</code> has a type - at least we know it's numeric. <strong>With context</strong> everything has a type - regardless of the language.</p>\n\n<p>This is why I said at the beginning - your question is one of semantics. What is the meaning of \"untyped\"? I think Brendan hit the nail on the head when he said \"no static types\" - because that's all it can possibly mean. Humans naturally classify things into types. We intuitively know that there is something fundamentally different between a car and a monkey - without ever being taught to make those distinctions. </p>\n\n<p>Getting back to my example in the beginning - a language that \"doesn't care about types\" (per-se) may let you \"add\" an \"age\" and a \"name\" without producing a syntax error... but that doesn't mean it's a logically sound operation.</p>\n\n<p>Javascript may let you do all sorts of crazy things without considering them \"errors\". That doesn't mean what you are doing is logically sound. Thats for the developer to work out. </p>\n\n<p>Is a system/language which doesn't enforce type safety at compile/build/interpretation time \"untyped\" or \"dynamically typed\"? </p>\n\n<p>Semantics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>I wanted to add something here because some people seem to be getting caught up on \"yeah, but Javascript does have some \"types\"\". </p>\n\n<p>In my comment on someone else's answer I said: </p>\n\n<p>In Javascript I could have objects I've built up to be \"Monkeys\" and objects I've built up to be \"Humans\" and some functions could be designed to operate on only \"Humans\", others on only \"Monkeys\", and yet others on only \"Things With Arms\". Whether or not the language has ever been told there is such a category of objects as \"things with arms\" is as irrelevant to assembly (\"untyped\") as it is to Javascript (\"dynamic\"). It's all a matter of logical integrity - and the only error would be using something that didn't have arms with that method. </p>\n\n<p><strong>So, if you consider Javascript to have some \"notion of types\" internally - and, hence \"dynamic types\" - and think this is somehow \"distinctly different from an untyped system\" - you should see from the above example that any \"notion of types\" it has internally is really irrelevant.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>To perform the same operation with C#, for example, I'd NEED an interface called <code>ICreatureWithArms</code> or something similar. Not so in Javascript - not so in C or ASM. </p>\n\n<p>Clearly, whether or not Javascript has any understanding of \"types\" at all is irrelevant. </p>\n",

Lambert, published 2012) says this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Languages without static type systems are usually called <strong>untyped languages</strong> (or <strong>dynamically typed languages</strong>). Such languages include Scheme and other dialects of Lisp, Smalltalk, and most scripting languages such as Perl, Python, and Ruby.

For example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[&hellip;] This is the primary information-hiding mechanism is many untyped languages. For instance PLT Scheme &#x5B;4&#x5D; uses generative <code>struct</code>s, [&hellip;]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&mdash; Jacob Matthews and Amal Ahmed, 2008 [<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=cbdyjmd3xqwC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=untyped-languages\">link</a>]</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[&hellip;], we present a binding-time analysis for an untyped functional language [&hellip;].

At least, several researchers mention Scheme and the lambda calculus in the same breath.</p>\n\n<p>What the search <em>doesn't</em> say, of course, is whether there are researchers who reject this identification, and <em>don't</em> consider these languages to be \"untyped\". Well, I did find this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I then realized that there is really no circularity, because dynamically typed languages are not untyped languages \u2014 it's just that the types are not usually immediately obvious from the program text.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&mdash; someone (I can't tell who), 1998 [<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=nH9VAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=untyped-languages\">link</a>]</p>\n\n<p>but obviously <em>most</em> people who reject this identification wouldn't feel a need to explicitly say so.</p>\n",

Old school C/C++ people (of which I was one) were thinking about the compiler and saying Ruby was untyped.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, in C, there are no runtime types, there are just addresses and if the code that's executing decides to treat whatever's at that address as something it isn't, whoops. That's definitely untyped and very different from dynamically typed.</p>\n\n<p>In that world, \"typing\" is all about the compiler. C++ had \"strong typing\" because the compiler's checks were more stringent. Java and C were more \"weakly typed\" (there were even arguments about whether Java was strongly or weakly typed). Dynamic languages were, in that continuum, \"untyped\" because they had no compiler type checking.</p>\n\n<p>Today, for practicing programmers, we're so used to dynamic languages, we obviously think of untyped to mean no compiler nor interpreter type-checking, which would be insanely hard to debug. But there was a period there where that wasn't obvious and in the more theoretical world of CS is may not even be meaningful.</p>\n\n<p>In some deep sense, nothing can be untyped (or almost nothing, anyway) because you must have some intent in manipulating a value to write a meaningful algorithm. This is the world of theoretical CS, which isn't dealing with the specifics of how a compiler or interpreter is implemented for a given language. So \"untyped\" is (probably, I don't know) entirely meaningless in that context.</p>\n",

All variables can range over all types of values and may be considered \"dynamically typed\" or \"untyped\" - from the perspective of type-checking a variable that has no/unknowable type and a variable that can take any type are logically and practically equivalent. When type theorists talk about languages and types, they are usually talking about this - variables carrying types - because they are interested in writing type checkers and compilers and so on, which operate on program text (i.e. variables) and not a running program in memory (i.e. values).</p>\n\n<p>By contrast in other languages, like C, variables carry types but values do not.

                    "body": "<p>If you have done Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript, you will know that you can create a class as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Person = function(id, name, age){\n    this.id = id;\n    this.name = name;\n    this.age = age;\n    alert('A new person has been accepted');\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So far our class person only has two properties and we are going to give it some methods. A clean way of doing this is\nto use its 'prototype' object.\nStarting from JavaScript 1.1, the prototype object was introduced in JavaScript. This is a built in object that\nsimplifies the process of adding custom properties and methods to all instances of an object.\nLet's add 2 methods to our class using its 'prototype' object as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Person.prototype = {\n    /** wake person up */\n    wake_up: function() {\n        alert('I am awake');\n    },\n\n    /** retrieve person's age */\n    get_age: function() {\n        return this.age;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we have defined our class Person. What if we wanted to define another class called Manager which inherits some properties from Person. There is no point redefining all this properties again when we define our Manager class, we can just set it to inherit from the class Person.\nJavaScript doesn't have built in inheritance but we can use a technique to implement inheritance as follows:</p>\n\n<p><code>Inheritance_Manager = {};</code>//We create an inheritance manager class (the name is arbitrary)</p>\n\n<p>Now let's give our inheritance class a method called extend which takes the baseClass and subClassas arguments.\nWithin the extend method, we will create an inner class called inheritance function inheritance() { }. The reason why we are using this inner\nclass is to avoid confusion between the baseClass and subClass prototypes.\nNext we make the prototype of our inheritance class point to the baseClass prototype as with the following code:\ninheritance.prototype = baseClass. prototype;\nThen we copy the inheritance prototype into the subClass prototype as follows: subClass.prototype = new inheritance();\nThe next thing is to specify the constructor for our subClass as follows: subClass.prototype.constructor = subClass;\nOnce finished with our subClass prototyping, we can specify the next two lines of code to set some base class pointers.</p>\n\n<pre><code>subClass.baseConstructor = baseClass;\nsubClass.superClass = baseClass.prototype;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is the full code for our extend function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Inheritance_Manager.extend = function(subClass, baseClass) {\n    function inheritance() { }\n    inheritance.prototype = baseClass.prototype;\n    subClass.prototype = new inheritance();\n    subClass.prototype.constructor = subClass;\n    subClass.baseConstructor = baseClass;\n    subClass.superClass = baseClass.prototype;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now that we have implemented our inheritance, we can start using it to extend our classes. In this case we are going to\nextend our Person class into a Manager class as follows:</p>\n\n<p>We define the Manager class</p>\n\n<pre><code>Manager = function(id, name, age, salary) {\n    Person.baseConstructor.call(this, id, name, age);\n    this.salary = salary;\n    alert('A manager has been registered.');\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>we make it inherit form Person</p>\n\n<pre><code>Inheritance_Manager.extend(Manager, Person);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you noticed, we have just called the extend method of our Inheritance_Manager class and passed the subClass Manager in our case and then the baseClass Person. Note that the order is very important here. If you swap them, the inheritance\nwill not work as you intended if at all.\nAlso note that you will need to specify this inheritance before you can actually define our subClass.\nNow let us define our subClass:</p>\n\n<p>We can add more methods as the one below. Our Manager class will always have the methods and properties defined in the Person class because it inherits from it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Manager.prototype.lead = function(){\n   alert('I am a good leader');\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now to test it let us create two objects, one from the class Person and one from the inherited class Manager:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var p = new Person(1, 'Joe Tester', 26);\nvar pm = new Manager(1, 'Joe Tester', 26, '20.000');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Feel free to get full code and more comments at: \n<a href=\"http://www.cyberminds.co.uk/blog/articles/how-to-implement-javascript-inheritance.aspx\">http://www.cyberminds.co.uk/blog/articles/how-to-implement-javascript-inheritance.aspx</a></p>\n",

Then specify the\ndependency for your application in slug.json.</p>\n\n<p>For example, suppose you wanted to add the coffee-script dependency. Just use npm \nto install the dependency and save it to your package.json file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1. npm --save install coffee-script\n2. Manually edit the slug.json file. Add \"coffee-script\" to \"dependencies\".\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Suppose I wanted to include your own module 'bloomfilters', and it wasn't in the npm \nregistry.

Add \"bloomfilters\" to \"dependencies\".\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Local modules</h3>\n\n<p>If you want to include your own coffee or javascript you can do so by adding\nthose files to the app/ folder.

                    "body": "<p>I use hem with npm, and I wanted to add some additional benefits that I think weren't covered so far.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hem has a self-contained web server (strata) so you can develop your code without even needing to recompile. I never use <code>hem build</code> unless I am publishing an app.</li>\n<li>You don't need to use Spine.js to use hem, you can use it to compile arbitrary coffeescript packages if you set up slug.json correctly. Here's one of my packages that is auto-compiled with cakefile: <a href=\"https://github.com/HarvardEconCS/TurkServer/tree/master/turkserver-js-client\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/HarvardEconCS/TurkServer/tree/master/turkserver-js-client</a></li>\n<li>Speaking of the above, hem allows you to link other dependencies on your local system in with npm link and combines them seamlessly even when you are using the strata server. In fact, you needn't even use the <code>cake</code> method above, you can just link directly to coffeescript from dependent projects.</li>\n<li>Hem supports <code>eco</code> (embedded Coffeescript) for views and Stylus for CSS, and compiles all that, along with your Coffeescript, into one JS and one CSS file.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here's a basic list for getting set up with a Spine, hem, coffeescript app. Feel free to ignore the Spine parts. In fact, sometimes I use <code>spine app</code> to set up a directory structure for a non-Spine app, then edit <code>slug.json</code> to change to a different compilation structure.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Install NPM: <code>curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh</code> on a *nix system. I'll assume it's available from the command line.</li>\n<li>Install hem globally (<code>npm install -g hem</code>). Development has branched as of late so you might want to get it straight out of github (<a href=\"https://github.com/spine/hem\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/spine/hem</a>), checkout a branch, and <code>npm install -g .</code> in that folder.</li>\n<li><code>npm install -g spine.app</code> will make spine available as a global command </li>\n<li><code>spine app folder</code> will make a Spine project called <code>app</code> in <code>folder</code>, generating the right directory structure and a bunch of skeleton files to get started.</li>\n<li><code>cd</code> to folder and edit <code>dependencies.json</code> for the libraries you need. Add them to <code>slug.json</code> so that hem knows where to find them as well. </li>\n<li>Optional: <code>npm link</code> any of your local packages in development to <code>node_modules</code>, and you can add them to <code>slug.json</code> for hem (either an <code>index.js</code> to include directly or an <code>index.coffee</code> if you want hem to compile it.)</li>\n<li><code>npm install .</code> to download all the dependencies you just entered in.</li>\n<li><p>If you take a look at the default spine config, there is a <code>app/lib/setup.coffee</code> where you <code>require</code> all the libraries you need from your dependencies. Examples:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Spine.app had these as dependencies by default\nrequire('json2ify')\nrequire('es5-shimify')\nrequire('jqueryify')\n\nrequire('spine')\nrequire('spine/lib/local')\nrequire('spine/lib/ajax')\nrequire('spine/lib/manager')\nrequire('spine/lib/route')\n\n# d3 was installed via dependencies.json\nrequire 'd3/d3.v2'\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>In <code>index.coffee</code>, you just <code>require lib/setup</code> and load the main controller for your app. In addition, you need to <code>require</code> any other classes in those other controllers. You can use <code>spine controller something</code> or <code>spine model something</code> to generate templates for controllers and models. Typical Spine controller looks like the following, using node's <code>require</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Spine = require('spine')\n# Require other controllers\nPayment = require('controllers/payment')\n\nclass Header extends Spine.Controller\n  constructor: -&gt;\n    # initialize the class\n\n  active: -&gt;\n    super\n    @render()\n\n  render: -&gt;\n    # Pull down some eco files\n    @html require('views/header')   \n\n# Makes this visible to other controllers    \nmodule.exports = Header\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>The default generated <code>index.html</code> will usually be fine for loading your app, but modify as necessary. Per your requirements, it only pulls in one <code>js</code> and one <code>css</code> file, which you never need to modify.</p></li>\n<li>Edit your stylus files as necessary in the <code>css</code> folder. It's a lot more flexible than CSS :)</li>\n<li>From <code>folder</code>, run <code>hem server</code> to start a hem server, and navigate to <code>localhost:9294</code> to see your app. (If you installed hem globally.) It has some hidden arguments, for example <code>--host 0.0.0.0</code> listens on all ports.</li>\n<li>Build the rest of your app using proper MVC techniques, and use stylus for CSS and eco for views. Or don't use Spine at all, and hem will still work great with Coffeescript and npm. There are many examples of projects using both models.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>One more thing: normally, <code>hem server</code> will update automatically as you update your code and save files, which makes it a cinch to debug. Running <code>hem build</code> will compile your app into two files, <code>application.js</code>, which is minified and <code>application.css</code>. If you run <code>hem server</code> after this, it will use those files and no longer update automatically. So don't <code>hem build</code> until you actually need a minified version of your app for deployment.</p>\n\n<p>Additional references: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11561014/spine-js-hem-getting-started\">Spine.js &amp; hem getting started</a></p>\n",

The <code>require</code> function is generated for that package. The package contains all the files your app could require. No further http requests are made because the package bundles all dependencies. This is as close as one can get to the Node.js style require on the client.</p>\n\n<p>The structure of the package is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>entryPoint: \"main\"\ndistribution:\n  main: \n    content: \"alert(\\\"It worked!\\\")\"\n  ...\ndependencies:\n  &lt;name&gt;: &lt;a package&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unlike Node a package doesn't know it's external name. It is up to the pacakge including the dependency to name it. This provides complete encapsulation.</p>\n\n<p>Given all that setup here's a function that loads a file from within a package:</p>\n\n<pre><code>loadModule = (pkg, path) -&gt;\n  unless (file = pkg.distribution[path])\n    throw \"Could not find file at #{path} in #{pkg.name}\" \n\n  program = file.content\n  dirname = path.split(fileSeparator)[0...-1].join(fileSeparator)\n\n  module =\n    path: dirname\n    exports: {}\n\n  context =\n    require: generateRequireFn(pkg, module)        \n    global: global\n    module: module\n    exports: module.exports\n    PACKAGE: pkg\n    __filename: path\n    __dirname: dirname\n\n  args = Object.keys(context)\n  values = args.map (name) -&gt; context[name]\n\n  Function(args..., program).apply(module, values)\n\n  return module\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This external context provides some variable that modules have access to.</p>\n\n<p>A <code>require</code> function is exposed to modules so they may require other modules.</p>\n\n<p>Additional properties such as a reference to the global object and some metadata\nare also exposed.</p>\n\n<p>Finally we execute the program within the module and given context.</p>\n\n<p>This answer will be most helpful to those who wish to have a synchronous node.js style require statement in the browser and are not interested in remote script loading solutions.</p>\n",

Perhaps you could automate this via build scripts too. Alternatively, you could expose UI or some other mechanism to flip this flag at run time. You can get much more sophisticated of course, with logging levels, ajax submission of logs based on log threshold (e.g. all Error level statements are transmitted to the server for storage there etc.).</p>\n\n<p>Many of these threads/questions around logging seem to think of log statements as debug code and not code <strong><em>instrumentation</em></strong>. Hence the desire to remove the log statements. Instrumentation is extremely useful when an application is in the wild and it's no longer as easy to attach a debugger or information is fed to you from a user or via support. You should never log anything sensitive, regardless of where it's been logged to so privacy/security should not be compromised. Once you think of the logging as instrumentation it now becomes production code and should be written to the same standard. </p>\n\n<p>With applications using ever more complex javascript I think instrumentation is critical.</p>\n",

It's a somewhat event-based way of thinking, but the \"events\" aren't tied to a specific object.</p>\n\n<p>I'll write out a big example below in some pseudo code that looks a bit like JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say we have a class Radio and a class Relay:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Relay {\n    function RelaySignal(signal) {\n        //do something we don't care about right now\n    }\n}\n\nclass Radio {\n    function ReceiveSignal(signal) {\n        //how do I send this signal to other relays?\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Whenever radio receives a signal, we want a number of relays to relay the message in some way. The number and types of relays can differ. We could do it like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Radio {\n    var relayList = [];\n\n    function AddRelay(relay) {\n        relayList.add(relay);\n    }\n\n    function ReceiveSignal(signal) {\n        for(relay in relayList) {\n            relay.Relay(signal);\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works fine. But now imagine we want a different component to also take part of the signals that the Radio class receives, namely Speakers:</p>\n\n<p>(sorry if the analogies aren't top notch...)</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Speakers {\n    function PlaySignal(signal) {\n        //do something with the signal to create sounds\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We could repeat the pattern again:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Radio {\n    var relayList = [];\n    var speakerList = [];\n\n    function AddRelay(relay) {\n        relayList.add(relay);\n    }\n\n    function AddSpeaker(speaker) {\n        speakerList.add(speaker)\n    }\n\n    function ReceiveSignal(signal) {\n\n        for(relay in relayList) {\n            relay.Relay(signal);\n        }\n\n        for(speaker in speakerList) {\n            speaker.PlaySignal(signal);\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We could make this even better by creating an interface, like \"SignalListener\", so that we only need one list in the Radio class, and always can call the same function on whatever object we have that wants to listen to the signal. But that still creates a coupling between whatever interface/base class/etc we decide on and the Radio class. Basically whenever you change one of the Radio, Signal or Relay class you have to think about how it could possibly affect the other two classes.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's try something different. Let's create a fourth class named RadioMast:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class RadioMast {\n\n    var receivers = [];\n\n    //this is the \"subscribe\"\n    function RegisterReceivers(signaltype, receiverMethod) {\n        //if no list for this type of signal exits, create it\n        if(receivers[signaltype] == null) {\n            receivers[signaltype] = [];\n        }\n        //add a subscriber to this signal type\n        receivers[signaltype].add(receiverMethod);\n    }\n\n    //this is the \"publish\"\n    function Broadcast(signaltype, signal) {\n        //loop through all receivers for this type of signal\n        //and call them with the signal\n        for(receiverMethod in receivers[signaltype]) {\n            receiverMethod(signal);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we have a <em>pattern</em> that we are aware of and we can use it for any number and types of classes as long as they:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>are aware of the RadioMast (the class handling all the message passing)</li>\n<li>are aware of the method signature for sending/receiving messages</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So we change the Radio class to its final, simple form:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Radio {\n    function ReceiveSignal(signal) {\n        RadioMast.Broadcast(\"specialradiosignal\", signal);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And we add the speakers and the relay to the RadioMast's receiver list for this type of signal:</p>\n\n<pre><code>RadioMast.RegisterReceivers(\"specialradiosignal\", speakers.PlaySignal);\nRadioMast.RegisterReceivers(\"specialradiosignal\", relay.RelaySignal);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the Speakers and Relay class has zero knowledge of anything except that they have a method that can receive a signal, and the Radio class, being the publisher, is aware of the RadioMast that it publishes signals to. This is the point of using a message-passing system like publish/subscribe.</p>\n",

Loosing coupling is a good thing because you can easily reuse the different modules. You\u2019re not coupled with the interfaces of other modules. Using publish/subscribe you\u2019re only coupled with the publish/subscribe interface which is not a big deal \u2013 just two methods. So if you decide to reuse a module in different project you can just copy and paste it and it\u2019ll probably work or at least you won\u2019t need much effort to make it work.</p>\n\n<p>As talking about loose coupling we should mention the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\">separation of concerns</a>. If you\u2019re building an application using MV* architectural pattern you have always a Model(s) and a View(s). The Model is the business part of the application. You can reuse it in different applications, so it\u2019s not a good idea to couple it with the View of a single application, where you want to show it, because usually in the different applications you have different views. So it\u2019s a good idea to use publish/subscribe for the Model-View communication. When your Model changes it publish an event, the View catch it and update itself. You don\u2019t have any overhead from the publish/subscribe, it helps you for the decoupling. In the same manner you can keep your application logic into the Controller for example (MVVM, MVP it\u2019s not exactly a Controller) and keep the View as simple as possible. When your View changes (or the user click on something, for example) it just publish a new event, the Controller catch it and decides what to do. If you are familiar with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\">MVC</a> pattern or with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVVM\">MVVM</a> in the Microsoft technologies (WPF/Silverlight) you can think for the publish/subscribe like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern\">Observer pattern</a>. This approach is used in frameworks like Backbone.js, Knockout.js (MVVM).</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Model\nfunction Book(name, isbn) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.isbn = isbn;\n}\n\nfunction BookCollection(books) {\n    this.books = books;\n}\n\nBookCollection.prototype.addBook = function (book) {\n    this.books.push(book);\n    $.publish('book-added', book);\n    return book;\n}\n\nBookCollection.prototype.removeBook = function (book) {\n   var removed;\n   if (typeof book === 'number') {\n       removed = this.books.splice(book, 1);\n   }\n   for (var i = 0; i &lt; this.books.length; i += 1) {\n      if (this.books[i] === book) {\n          removed = this.books.splice(i, 1);\n      }\n   }\n   $.publish('book-removed', removed);\n   return removed;\n}\n\n//View\nvar BookListView = (function () {\n\n   function removeBook(book) {\n      $('#' + book.isbn).remove();\n   }\n\n   function addBook(book) {\n      $('#bookList').append('&lt;div id=\"' + book.isbn + '\"&gt;' + book.name + '&lt;/div&gt;');\n   }\n\n   return {\n      init: function () {\n         $.subscribe('book-removed', removeBook);\n         $.subscribe('book-aded', addBook);\n      }\n   }\n}());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Another example. If you don\u2019t like the MV* approach you can use something a little different (there\u2019s an intersection between the one I\u2019ll describe next and the last mentioned). Just structure your application in different modules. For example look at Twitter.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3M4MJ.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter Modules\"></p>\n\n<p>If you look at the interface you simply have different boxes. You can think of each box as different module. For example you can post a tweet. This action requires update of few modules. Firstly it has to update your profile data (upper left box) but it also has to update your timeline. Of course, you can keep references to both modules and update them separately using their public interface but it\u2019s easier (and better) to just publish an event. This will make the modification of your application easier because of loosing coupling. If you develop new module which depends on new tweets you can just subscribe to the \u201cpublish-tweet\u201d event and handle it. This approach is very useful and can make your application very decoupled. You can reuse your modules very easy.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a basic example of the last approach (this is not original twitter code it\u2019s just a sample by me):</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Twitter.Timeline = (function () {\n   var tweets = [];\n   function publishTweet(tweet) {\n      tweets.push(tweet);\n      //publishing the tweet\n   };\n   return {\n      init: function () {\n         $.subscribe('tweet-posted', function (data) {\n             publishTweet(data);\n         });\n      }\n   };\n}());\n\n\nvar Twitter.TweetPoster = (function () {\n   return {\n       init: function () {\n           $('#postTweet').bind('click', function () {\n               var tweet = $('#tweetInput').val();\n               $.publish('tweet-posted', tweet);\n           });\n       }\n   };\n}());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For this approach there's an excellent talk by <a href=\"http://www.nczonline.net/\">Nicholas Zakas</a>. For the MV* approach the best articles and books, I know, are published by <a href=\"http://addyosmani.com/blog/\">Addy Osmani</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Drawbacks. You have to be careful about the excessive use of publish/subscribe. If you\u2019ve got hundreds of events it can become very confusing to manage all of them. You may also have collisions if you\u2019re not using namespacing (or not using it in the right way). An advanced implementation of mediator which looks much like an publish/subscribe can be found here <a href=\"https://github.com/ajacksified/Mediator.js\">https://github.com/ajacksified/Mediator.js</a>. It has namespacing and feature like event \u201cbubbling\u201d which, of course, can be interrupted. Another drawback of the publish/subscribe is the hard unit testing, it may become difficult to isolate the different functions in the modules and test them independently.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that I've helped you and answered the question clear enough.</p>\n",

                    "body": "<p>Since you asked a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/18523070/343721\">similar question</a>, let's take it step by step. It's a bit longer, but it may save you much more time than I have spent on writing this:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Property</strong> is an OOP feature designed for clean separation of client code. For example, in some e-shop you might have objects like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function Product(name,price) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.price = price;\n  this.discount = 0;\n}\n\nvar sneakers = new Product(\"Sneakers\",20); // {name:\"Sneakers\",price:20,discount:0}\nvar tshirt = new Product(\"T-shirt\",10);  // {name:\"T-shirt\",price:10,discount:0}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then in your client code (the e-shop), you can add discounts to your products:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function badProduct(obj) { obj.discount+= 20; ... }\nfunction generalDiscount(obj) { obj.discount+= 10; ... }\nfunction distributorDiscount(obj) { obj.discount+= 15; ... }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Later, the e-shop owner might realize that the discount can't be greater than say 80%. Now you need to find EVERY place in the client code and add a line</p>\n\n<pre><code>if(obj.discount&gt;80) obj.discount = 80;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then the e-shop owner may further change his strategy, like <em>\"if the customer is reseller, the maximal discount can be 90%\"</em>. And you need to do the change on multiple places again plus you need to remember to alter these lines whenever the strategy is changed. This is a bad design. That's why <strong><em>encapsulation</em></strong> is the basic principle of OOP. If the constructor was like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function Product(name,price) {\n  var _name=name, _price=price, _discount=0;\n  this.getName = function() { return _name; }\n  this.setName = function(value) { _name = value; }\n  this.getPrice = function() { return _price; }\n  this.setPrice = function(value) { _price = value; }\n  this.getDiscount = function() { return _discount; }\n  this.setDiscount = function(value) { _discount = value; } \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then you can just alter the <code>getDiscount</code> (<em>accessor</em>) and <code>setDiscount</code> (<em>mutator</em>) methods. The problem is that most of the members behave like common variables, just the discount needs special care here. But good design requires encapsulation of every data member to keep the code extensible. So you need to add lots of code that does nothing. This is also a bad design, a <em>boilerplate antipattern</em>. Sometimes you can't just refactor the fields to methods later (the eshop code may grow large or some third-party code may depend on the old version), so the boilerplate is lesser evil here. But still, it is evil. That's why properties were introduced into many languages. You could keep the original code, just transform the discount member into a property with <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> blocks:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function Product(name,price) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.price = price;\n  var _discount; // private member\n  Object.defineProperty(this,\"discount\",{  // this answers the comment (pun intended)\n    get: function() { return _discount; },\n    set: function(value) { _discount = value; if(_discount&gt;80) _discount = 80; }\n  });\n}\n\n// the client code\nvar sneakers = new Product(\"Sneakers\",20);\nsneakers.discount = 50; // 50, setter is called\nsneakers.discount+= 20; // 70, setter is called\nsneakers.discount+= 20; // 80, not 90!\nalert(sneakers.discount); // getter is called\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note the last but one line: the responsibility for correct discount value was moved from the client code (e-shop definition) to the product definition. The product is responsible for keeping its data members consistent. Good design is (roughly said) if the code works the same way as our thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>So much about properties. But javascript is different from pure Object-oriented languages like C# and codes the features differently:</p>\n\n<p><strong>In C#</strong>, transforming fields into properties is a <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/abhinaba/archive/2006/04/11/572694.aspx\">breaking change</a>, so public fields should be coded as <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/cs-cz/library/bb384054.aspx\">Auto-Implemented Properties</a> if your code might be used in separatedly compiled client.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In Javascript</strong>, the standard properties (data member with getter and setter described above) are defined by <em>accessor descriptor</em> (in the link you have in your question). Exclusively, you can use <em>data descriptor</em> (so you can't use i.e. <em>value</em> and <em>set</em> on the same property):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>accessor descriptor</strong> = get + set (see the example above)\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>get</em></strong> must be a function; its return value is used in reading the property; if not specified, the default is <em>undefined</em>, which behaves like a function that returns undefined</li>\n<li><strong><em>set</em></strong> must be a function; its parameter is filled with RHS in assigning a value to property; if not specified, the default is <em>undefined</em>, which behaves like an empty function</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>data descriptor</strong> = value + writable (see the example below)\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>value</em></strong> default <em>undefined</em>; if <em>writable</em>, <em>configurable</em> and <em>enumerable</em> (see below) are true, the property behaves like an ordinary data field</li>\n<li><strong><em>writable</em></strong> - default <em>false</em>; if not <em>true</em>, the property is read only; attempt to write is ignored without error!</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both descriptors can have these members:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>configurable</em></strong> - default <em>false</em>; if not true, the property can't be deleted; attempt to delete is ignored without error!</li>\n<li><strong><em>enumerable</em></strong> - default <em>false</em>; if true, it will be iterated in <code>for(var i in theObject)</code>; if false, it will not be iterated, but it is still accessible as public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Learn by example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var o = {};\nObject.defineProperty(o,\"test\",{\n  value: \"a\",\n  configurable: true\n});\n\nfor(var i in o) console.log(o[i]); // nothing, o.test is not enumerable\nconsole.log(o.test); // \"a\"\no.test = \"b\"; // o.test is still \"a\", (is not writable, no error)\ndelete(o.test); // bye bye, o.test (was configurable)\no.test = \"b\"; // o.test is \"b\"\nfor(var i in o) console.log(o[i]); // \"b\", default fields are enumerable\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You don't need to use this if you write just a few lines fun. But if you want to code a game (as you mentioned in the linked question), you should really care about good design. Try to google something about <em>antipatterns</em> and <em>code smell</em>. It will help you to avoid the situations like <em>\"Oh, I need to completely rewrite my code again!\"</em>, it can save you months of despair if you want to code a lot. Good luck.</p>\n",

RequireJS' <code>domReady</code> dependency signifies that this module requires the DOM to be completely loaded before it can be run (and can therefore be found in any number of modules in your application if you so desire), while <code>$(document).ready()</code> instead fires off its callback functions when the DOM is done loading. </p>\n\n<p>The difference may seem subtle, but think of this: I have a module that needs to be coupled to the DOM in some way, so I can either depend on <code>domReady</code> and couple it at module definition time, or put down a <code>$(document).ready()</code> at the end of it with a callback to an init function for the module. I'd call the first approach cleaner.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, if I have an event that needs to happen right as the DOM is ready, the <code>$(document).ready()</code> event would be the go-to, since that does not in particular depend on RequireJS being done loading modules, provided the dependencies of the code you're calling it from are met.</p>\n\n<p>It's also worth considering that you do not necessarily use RequireJS with jQuery. Any library module that needs DOM access (but does not rely on jQuery) would then still be useful by using <code>domReady</code>.</p>\n",

It's a mechanism to execute javascript on domReady. If you didn't have jQuery I would advocate the domReady plugin. Since you have jQuery then don't load more scripts to do something that is already available.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clarity Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>The domReady plugin <a href=\"https://github.com/requirejs/domReady/blob/master/domReady.js#L21\">collects functions</a> to call when the document is 'ready'.

For instance:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.notransition {\n  -webkit-transition: none !important;\n  -moz-transition: none !important;\n  -o-transition: none !important;\n  -ms-transition: none !important;\n  transition: none !important;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But that's just style, and is the easy bit. When you come to try and use this class, you'll run into a trap. The trap is that code like this won't work the way you might naively expect:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Don't do things this way! It doesn't work!\n$someElement.addClass('notransition')\n$someElement.css('height', '50px') // just an example; could be any CSS change\n$someElement.removeClass('notransition')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Naively, you might think that the change in height won't be animated, because it happens while the 'notransition' class is applied. In reality, though, it <em>will</em> be animated, at least in all modern browsers I've tried. The problem is that the browser is caching the styling changes that it needs to make until the JavaScript has finished executing, and then making all the changes in a single reflow. As a result, it does a reflow where there is no net change to whether or not transitions are enabled, but there is a net change to the height. Consequently, it animates the height change.</p>\n\n<p>You might think a reasonable and clean way to get around this would be to wrap the removal of the 'notransition' class in a 1ms timeout, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Don't do things this way! It STILL doesn't work!\n$someElement.addClass('notransition')\n$someElement.css('height', '50px') // just an example; could be any CSS change\nsetTimeout(function () {$someElement.removeClass('notransition')}, 1);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but this doesn't reliably work either. I wasn't able to make the above code break in WebKit browsers, but on Firefox (on both slow and fast machines) you'll sometimes (seemingly at random) get the same behaviour as using the naive approach. I guess the reason for this is that it's possible for the JavaScript execution to be slow enough that the timeout function is waiting to execute by the time the browser is idle and would otherwise be thinking about doing an opportunistic reflow, and if that scenario happens, Firefox executes the queued function before the reflow.</p>\n\n<p>The only solution I've found to the problem is to <em>force</em> a reflow of the element, flushing the CSS changes made to it, before removing the 'notransition' class. There are various ways to do this - see <a href=\"http://gent.ilcore.com/2011/03/how-not-to-trigger-layout-in-webkit.html\">here</a> for some. The closest thing there is to a 'standard' way of doing this is to read the <code>offsetHeight</code> property of the element.</p>\n\n<p>One solution that actually works, then, is</p>\n\n<pre><code>$someElement.addClass('notransition'); // Disable transitions\ndoWhateverCssChangesYouWant($someElement);\n$someElement[0].offsetHeight; // Trigger a reflow, flushing the CSS changes\n$someElement.removeClass('notransition'); // Re-enable transitions\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's a JS fiddle that illustrates the three possible approaches I've described here (both the one successful approach and the two unsuccessful ones):\n<a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/2uVAA/35/\">http://jsfiddle.net/2uVAA/35/</a></p>\n",

                    "body": "<p>Firstly, everything above is correct.</p>\n\n<h2>This is all about JavaScript history</h2>\n\n<p>There are a number of functions that are available in various browser's devtools consoles. Collectively, the methods are known as the <a href=\"http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Command_Line_API\">Command Line API</a> and they all originate from Firebug. Nowadays we just have parity across browsers because Firebug did things (mostly) right.</p>\n\n<p>But back when Firebug was being created (2006), the JavaScript library that was all the rage was Prototype.js. <code>$</code> was grabbed by Prototype for some <code>getElementById()</code> syntactic sugar as that was certainly the quickest way to be grabbing elements and most common element acquisition technique at the time. It was such a timesaver, folks used <a href=\"http://abcdefu.wordpress.com/2006/12/27/prototypejs/\">the whole library just for the $ sugar</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In early 2006, jQuery then debuted and used <code>$()</code> for selecting any element based on css selector. As my old <a href=\"http://paulirish.com/2008/javascript-css-selector-engine-timeline/\">CSS Selector Engine Timeline post</a> shows, Prototype then followed up <strong>four days later</strong> with their own, but as <code>$</code> was already taken in their library they just went to <code>$$()</code>, which is now known as <strong>the bling-bling function</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>So Firebug was leveraging Prototype's API as it was still ruling the roost in 2006. Now, in the days of jQuery and post-jQuery aliasing like <code>window.$ = document.querySelectorAll.bind(document)</code>, we see it as quite backwards. Interestingly, when Opera revolutionized Dragonfly, their browser dev tools, they chose <code>$</code> as their <code>querySelectorAll</code> alias, to better match present day practices, which IMO makes a bit more sense. </p>\n\n<h2>Oh you meant the <em>code</em> source..</h2>\n\n<p>Now, you asked about the \"source\" of the <code>$$</code> in DevTools and I explained the history. Whoops! As to why it's available in your console... all of the <a href=\"http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Command_Line_API\">Command Line API</a> methods are available only within the context of your console, just as convenience methods. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/inspector/InjectedScriptSource.js\">Chrome DevTools'/WebKit Inspector's cmd line API source</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/firebug/firebug/blob/master/extension/content/firebug/console/commandLineAPI.js\">Firebug's cmd line API source</a></li>\n<li><s><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/scope/dragonfly-stp-1/src/f6b4cef0c438/src/repl/commandtransformer.js\">Opera Dragonfly's cmd line API source</a></s></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><code>copy()</code> is one of my favorites; I cover it and others in this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mf_yNLlgic\">JavaScript Console for Power Users</a> video.</p>\n",

                    "body": "<p>Thanks to Andy Joslin. I picked his idea of wrapping the resource actions. The service for the resource looks like this now:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.factory('Todo', ['$resource', 'TokenHandler', function($resource, tokenHandler) {\n  var resource = $resource('http://localhost:port/todos/:id', {\n    port:\":3001\",\n    id:'@id'\n    }, {\n      update: {method: 'PUT'}\n    });\n\n  resource = tokenHandler.wrapActions( resource, [\"query\", \"update\"] );\n\n  return resource;\n}])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see the resource is defined the usual way in the first place. In my example this includes a custom action called <code>update</code>. Afterwards the resource is overwritten by the return of the <code>tokenHandler.wrapAction()</code> method which takes the resource and an array of actions as parameters.</p>\n\n<p>As you would expect the latter method actually wraps the actions to include the auth token in every request and returns a modified resource. So let's have a look at the code for that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.factory('TokenHandler', function() {\n  var tokenHandler = {};\n  var token = \"none\";\n\n  tokenHandler.set = function( newToken ) {\n    token = newToken;\n  };\n\n  tokenHandler.get = function() {\n    return token;\n  };\n\n  // wrap given actions of a resource to send auth token with every\n  // request\n  tokenHandler.wrapActions = function( resource, actions ) {\n    // copy original resource\n    var wrappedResource = resource;\n    for (var i=0; i &lt; actions.length; i++) {\n      tokenWrapper( wrappedResource, actions[i] );\n    };\n    // return modified copy of resource\n    return wrappedResource;\n  };\n\n  // wraps resource action to send request with auth token\n  var tokenWrapper = function( resource, action ) {\n    // copy original action\n    resource['_' + action]  = resource[action];\n    // create new action wrapping the original and sending token\n    resource[action] = function( data, success, error){\n      return resource['_' + action](\n        angular.extend({}, data || {}, {access_token: tokenHandler.get()}),\n        success,\n        error\n      );\n    };\n  };\n\n  return tokenHandler;\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see the <code>wrapActions()</code> method creates a copy of the resource from it's parameters and loops through the <code>actions</code> array to call another function <code>tokenWrapper()</code> for every action. In the end it returns the modified copy of the resource.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>tokenWrapper</code>method first of all creates a copy of preexisting resource action. This copy has a trailing underscore. So <code>query()</code>becomes <code>_query()</code>. Afterwards a new method overwrites the original <code>query()</code> method. This new method wraps <code>_query()</code>, as suggested by Andy Joslin, to provide the auth token with every request send through that action.</p>\n\n<p>The good thing with this approach is, that we still can use the predefined actions which come with every angularjs resource (get, query, save, etc.), without having to redefine them. And in the rest of the code (within controllers for example) we can use the default action name.</p>\n",

                    "body": "<h1>bower</h1>\n\n<p>It's still very popular among front-end developers, even though it has very few features. Every front-end package is using it. There is also an <a href=\"https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/1520\" rel=\"nofollow\">initiative to merge bower into npm</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Bower is optimized for the client-side and supports only flat dependency trees, i.e. <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/18652918/1269037\">each library must be used only once</a> (since it's expensive to ship different versions of the same library to the client), and the dependency constraints must be resolved by the user.</p>\n\n<p>You can expect to find anything that is front-end related in the bower registry (<code>bower search &lt;some keyword&gt;</code>) -- in my opinion, that's the biggest advantage of bower in relation to other package managers.</p>\n\n<h1>volo</h1>\n\n<p>I have still not used it for more than 5 minutes in years. Don't know about it, <a href=\"https://github.com/volojs/volo/wiki/Creating-a-volofile\" rel=\"nofollow\">but from what I can see</a> it does include some build tool, which is very familiar to Grunt users.</p>\n\n<h1>npm</h1>\n\n<p>Yes, npm stands for Node Package Manager. But nowadays you can use it for everything; people are no longer only <code>npm install</code>ing things and expecting them to work <em>only</em> in the Node environment. For example, there are many <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=bootstrap\" rel=\"nofollow\">npm packages for Twitter Bootstrap</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Npm is optimized for server-side usage, with a nested dependency tree. Each  dependency can have its own dependencies which can have their own, and so on. This eliminated dependency version conflicts as each dependency can use their own version of e.g. Underscore. However, the upcoming <a href=\"http://blog.npmjs.org/post/110924823920/npm-weekly-5\" rel=\"nofollow\">npm version 3 will flatten the dependency tree</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With npm@3, your node_modules directory will be a lot flatter. All of your dependencies and most of your subdependencies (and (sub)+dependencies) will be sitting next to each other at the top level. Only when there are conflicts will modules be installed at deeper levels. This should make things a lot easier for Windows users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some advantages I see on using npm:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It's used by all the other package managers (component, bower, volo, JSPM, etc);</li>\n<li>Allows using build scripts;</li>\n<li>Lots of tools are available for introspecting npm-based packages</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>npm is the package manager for JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/c2EZppo.png\" alt=\"npmjs.com screenshot\"></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As of february of 2013, my opinion was the following. <strong>Please don't take it into account anymore.</strong></p>\n\n<h1>npm</h1>\n\n<p>It's better to stick with it when you are with a Node project, there are very few projects that are available to browsers also...</p>\n\n<h1>bower</h1>\n\n<p>Bower is the pop guy right now. They have lots of projects under their hood, and the project maintainers like to keep them up-to-date in the bower registry...</p>\n\n<p>It's a shame that he's sometimes a little buggy.</p>\n\n<h1>volo</h1>\n\n<p>I haven't tried volo for more than 5 minutes since so, but from what I could see it looks to be more flexible than bower.</p>\n\n<p>A negative point for volo is that their projects are very outdated.</p>\n",

In that sense using NPM feels more natural to me than having to manage two different tools for the same purpose.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that bower have more packages available, at least for the more popular ones. But soon <a href=\"http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13119\">jQuery will be also be available in NPM directly</a> and probably all the other libraries will follow the same trend.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, since there are tools like <strong><a href=\"http://browserify.org/\">browserify</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake\">webmake</a></strong> out there, that help use node modules in the browser, there is not anymore a real need for <strong>bower</strong> or <strong>volo</strong>, unless they offer something else for you (a particular module existing only in their registries).</p>\n\n<p>Both <strong>Volo</strong> and <strong>Bower</strong> are good too, but from my point of view, if you're already using NPM, it might be better to stick to it.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that <strong>you can use NPM to manage your client dependencies even without using browserify or webmake</strong>. In most of the projects I have being working on, after the npm modules are installed I run an script to deploy them to the location where my client app uses them. Sometimes I use grunt to concatenate that file with other js files and sometimes I reference it directly from the template files of my web apps. In any case, this is a personal preference. Others could find Bower or Volo easier to use as they fit more natural in their workflows. </p>\n",

Including multiple copies of a module is central to how NPM's dependency management works, and NPM is therefore wholly unsuited to client side package management.</p>\n\n<p>A consequence of the above is that bower package maintainers and consumers have to be more mindful of maintaining their dependency version numbers to avoid conflicts, but it's a price worth paying.

The potential advantages of one technique over the other will be due to these differences.</p>\n\n<h2>Concision</h2>\n\n<p>Javascript is a language where <strong>concision</strong> can be very important, because Javascript is <em>downloaded when the page loads</em>. That means that the more concise the Javascript, <em>the faster the download time</em>. For this reason, there are Javascript <a href=\"http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html\">minifiers</a> and <a href=\"http://javascript-obfuscator.com/\">obfuscators</a> that compress the Javascript files to optimize the download time.

I would suggest you to look for at least a basic tutorial about jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>You'll always have to define which elements should have a tooltip. And I don't understand why Bootstrap should provide the class, you define those classes or yourself. Maybe you were hoping that bootstrap did automatically some magic? This magic however, can cause a lot of problems as well (unwanted side effects).</p>\n\n<p>This magic can be easily achieved to just write <code>$(\".myclass\").tooltip()</code>, this line of code does exact what you want. The only thing you have to do is attach the myclass class to those elements that need to apply the tooltip thingy. (Just make sure you run that line of code after your DOM has been loaded. See below.)</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(\".myclass\").tooltip();\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>EDIT: apparently you can't use the class <em>tooltip</em> (probably because it is somewhere internally used!).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I'm just wondering why bootstrap doesn't run the code you specified with some class I can include.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The thing you want produces almost the same code as you have to do now. The biggest reason however they did not do that, is because it causes a lot of trouble. One person wants to assign it to an element with an ID; others want to assign it to elements with a specified classname; and again others want to assign it to one specified element achieved through some selection process. Those 3 options cause extra complexity, while it is already provided by jQuery. I haven't seen many plugins do what you want (just because it is needless; it really doesn't save you code).</p>\n",

                    "body": "<p>I think your question boils down to what proper selector to use when setting up your tooltips, and the answer to that is almost whatever you want. If you want to use a class to trigger your tooltips you can do that, take the following for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"#\" class=\"link\" data-original-title=\"first tooltip\"&gt;Hover me for a tooltip&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then you can trigger all links with the <code>.link</code> class attached as tooltips like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('.link').tooltip()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, to answer your question as to why the bootstrap developers did not use a class to trigger tooltips that is because it is not needed exactly, you can pretty much use any selectors you want to target your tooltips, such as (my personal favorite) the <code>rel</code> attribute. With this attribute you can target all links or elements with the <code>rel</code> property set to <code>tooltip</code>, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('[rel=tooltip]').tooltip() \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And your links would look like something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"#\" rel=\"tooltip\" data-original-title=\"first tooltip\"&gt;Hover me for a tooltip&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of course, you can also use a container class or id to target your tooltips inside an specific container that you want to single out with an specific option or to separate from the rest of your content and you can use it like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#example').tooltip({\n    selector: \"a[rel=tooltip]\"\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This selector will target all of your tooltips with the <code>rel</code> attribute \"within\" your <code>#example</code> div, this way you can add special styles or options to that section alone. In short, you can pretty much use any valid selector to target your tooltips and there is no need to dirty your markup with an extra class to target them.</p>\n",

The testing framework itself uses the jQuery library, but the tests can be written for any JavaScript and do not require the code to use jQuery.  JQUnit is a modified version of QUnit that adds in the setup, teardown, and assert functions that are more typical of an xUnit framework, and encapsulates everything in one global variable.  </p>\n\n<p>The visual interface of the testrunner page is nice, allowing you to drill down and see each assert in every test method.  Writing tests is fairly easy, and you can run the test code directly on the testRunner page [8].

The main reason is that what's right for JavaScript is not likely what is right for a strongly typed language such as Java. </p>\n\n<p>Many JavaScript mocking frameworks are inspired by Java mock frameworks (such as the excellent JsMockito, for example). But the problem with these is that they <strong>require</strong> dependency injection, because that's about the only reasonable way to use mocking in Java. But in JavaScript, there are MANY ways to use mocking, and you are not <strong>forced</strong> into using dependency injection everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>For example, with JsMockito, you have to make mocks and then <strong>pass those mocks into</strong> your software-under-test (SUT). The SUT has to directly call the mocks. Therefore, you're forced to code the SUT as a constructor or function that takes in all its dependencies as parameters. (Sometimes, that's a fine way to implement it, but not in every case. The tail is wagging the dog if your mocking framework's design forces your implementation approach). </p>\n\n<p>In JavaScript, it's very easy to \"hijack\" any function. Therefore, there are tons of ways to build something such that you can mock parts of it without explicitly injecting its dependencies into it. For example, Jack lets you mock <em>any</em> function, whether it is public or on a local object. From there you can spy on it, stub it, or express expectations on it. The key point is this: <strong>once you've mocked a function, ANY calls to that original function will instead be directed to your mock</strong>. In other words, your mocks will still get used even though the original, un-mocked function was called. As a result, you are not forced to inject dependencies, although you certainly can do so in those cases which call for it.</p>\n\n<p>JavaScript is a different language than Java (and C#, etc.) It allows for different implementation idioms. <strong>Dependency injection is still one valuable tool in the toolbox in JavaScript, but it is not the only game in town anymore.</strong> Your mocking framework needs to know and respect that fact. Jack and a couple of others do, but of the ones that do, Jack appears to be the most mature and feature-rich.</p>\n",

In another case we should display error message. Of course we have no reasons to add a new model to our collection until it has been validated and saved on server.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><strong>It's subviews all the way down... subviews become zombie-like or do not respond.</strong></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>when you (or any model) calling render method, all elements inside it will be recreated. So in case when you have subviews, you should call <code>subView.delegateEvents(subView.events);</code> for all of subviews; Probably this method is little trick, but it works.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><strong>Flickering..</strong></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Using thumbnails for big and medium images will minimize flickering in lot of cases. Other way, you could separate rendering of view to images and other content.</p>\n\n<p>Example: </p>\n\n<pre><code>var smartView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  initialize: function(){\n    this.model.on( \"imageUpdate\", this.imageUpdate, this );\n    this.model.on( \"contentUpdate\", this.contentUpdate, this );\n  },\n\n  render: function(){\n    this.$el.html(this.template(this.model.toJSON()));\n  },\n\n  imageUpdate: function(){\n    this.$el.find('#image').attr('src', this.model.get('imageUrl'));\n  },\n  contentUpdate: function(){\n    this.$el.find('#content').html(this.model.get('content'));\n  }\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I hope this helps anyone.

I usually refresh a collection every time it's needed by a view.</p>\n\n<p>My favorite way to eager load is by using <a href=\"https://github.com/PaulUithol/Backbone-relational/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backbone-relational</a>. If I organize my app in a hierarchical manner. Consider this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Organization model\n|--&gt; Event model\n|--&gt; News model\n   |--&gt; Comment model\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So when a user is viewing an <code>organization</code> I can eager load that organization's <code>events</code> and <code>news</code>. And when a user is viewing a <code>news</code> article, I eager load that article's <code>comments</code>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/PaulUithol/Backbone-relational/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backbone-relational</a> provides a great interface for querying related records from the server.</p>\n\n<h2>Too many things render themselves too much...</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/PaulUithol/Backbone-relational/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backbone-relational</a> helps here too! <a href=\"https://github.com/PaulUithol/Backbone-relational/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backbone-relational</a> provides a global record store that proves to be very useful. This way, you can pass around IDs and retrieve the same model elsewhere. If you update it in one place, its available in another.</p>\n\n<p><code>a_model_instance = Model.findOrCreate({id: 1})</code></p>\n\n<p>Another tool here is <a href=\"https://github.com/theironcook/Backbone.ModelBinder\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backbone.ModelBinder</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/theironcook/Backbone.ModelBinder\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backbone.ModelBinder</a> lets you build your templates and forget about attaching to view changes. So in your example of collecting information and showing it in the header, just tell <a href=\"https://github.com/theironcook/Backbone.ModelBinder\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backbone.ModelBinder</a> to watch BOTH of those elements, and on input <code>change</code>, your model will be updated and on model <code>change</code> you view will be updated, so now the header will be updated.</p>\n\n<h2>It's subviews all the way down... subviews become zombie-like or do not respond...</h2>\n\n<p>I really like <a href=\"https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backbone.Marionette</a>. It handles a lot of the cleanup for you and adds an <code>onShow</code> callback that can be useful when temporarily removing views from the DOM.</p>\n\n<p>This also helps to facilitate attaching jQuery plugins. The onShow method is called after the view is rendered and added to the DOM so that jQuery plugin code can function properly.</p>\n\n<p>It also provides some cool view templates like <code>CollectionView</code> that does a great job of managing a collection and its subviews.</p>\n\n<h2>Flickering</h2>\n\n<p>Unfortunately I don't have much experience with this, but you could try pre-loading the images as well. Render them in a hidden view and then bring them forward.</p>\n",

            "body": "<p>For the last six months I've been working with Backbone. The first two months were messing around, learning and figuring out how I want to structure my code around it. The next 4 months were pounding away a production-fit application. Don't get me wrong, Backbone has saved me from the thousands-lines mess of client side code that were the standard before, but it enabled me to do more grandiose things in less time, opening up a complete new stack of problems. For all the questions I raise here there are simple solutions that feels like hacks or just feel <em>wrong</em>. I promise a 300 points bounty for an awesome solution. Here goes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Loading</strong> - For our use case (an admin panel) pessimistic syncing is bad. For some things I need to validate things on the server before accepting them. We started out before the 'sync' event was merged into Backbone,</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>and we used this little code for mimicking the loading event:</p>\n\n<pre><code>window.old_sync = Backbone.sync\n\n# Add a loading event to backbone.sync\nBackbone.sync = (method, model, options) -&gt;\n  old_sync(method, model, options)\n  model.trigger(\"loading\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Great. It works as expected but it doesn't feel correct. We bind this event to all the relevant views and display a loading icon until we receive a success or error event from that model. Is there a better, saner, way to do this?</p>\n\n<p>Now for the hard ones:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Too many things render themselves too much</strong> - Let's say our application have tabs. Every tab controls a collection. On the left side you get the collection. You click a model to start editing it at the center. You change its name and press tab to get to the next form item. Now, your app is a \"real time something something\" that notices the difference, runs validations, and automatically sync the change to the server, no save button required! Great, but the H2 at the start of the form is the same name as in the input - you need to update it. Oh, and you need to update the name on the list to the side. OH, and the list sorts itself by names!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Here's another example: You want to create a new item in the collection. You press the \"new\" button and you start filling out the form. Do you immediately add the item to the collection? But what happens if you decided to discard it? Or if you save the entire collection on another tab? And, there's a file upload - You need to save and sync the model before you can start uploading the file (so you can attach the file to the model). So everything starts rendering in tremors: You save the model and the list and the form renders themselves again - it's synced now, so you get a new delete button, and it shows in the list - but now the file upload finished uploading, so everything starts rendering again. </p>\n\n<p>Add subviews to the mix and everything starts looking like a Fellini movie.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>It's subviews all the way down</strong> - <a href=\"http://ianstormtaylor.com/rendering-views-in-backbonejs-isnt-always-simple/\">Here's a good article about this stuff</a>. I could not, for the love of everything that is holy, find a correct way to attach jQuery plugins or DOM events to any view that has subviews. Hell ensues promptly. Tooltips hear a render coming a long and start freaking around, subviews become zombie-like or do not respond. This is the main pain points as here actual bugs stand, but I still don't have an all encompassing solution.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Flickering</strong> - Rendering is fast. In fact, it is so fast that my screen looks like it had a seizure. Sometimes it's images that has to load again (with another server call!), so the html minimizes and then maximizes again abruptly - a css width+height for that element will fix that. sometimes we can solve this with a fadeIn and a fadeOut - which are a pain in the ass to write, since sometimes we're reusing a view and sometimes creating it anew.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - I'm having problems with views and subviews in Backbone - It renders too many times, it flickers when it renders, subviews detach my DOM events and eat my brains.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>More details: BackboneJS with the Ruby on Rails Gem.

But some languages don't have folding rules built into their syntax files.  For example Python.  For those languages you need to download something from <a href=\"http://vim.sf.net\">http://vim.sf.net</a> that does folds.  Otherwise you will need to use folds based on indents.  To do this effectively you will likely want to add the following to your .vimrc file: </p>\n\n<pre><code>set foldmethod=indent\nset foldnestmax=2\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Other kinds of folding</h1>\n\n<p>There are 6 types of folds:</p>\n\n<pre><code>manual          manually define folds\nindent          more indent means a higher fold level\nexpr            specify an expression to define folds\nsyntax          folds defined by syntax highlighting\ndiff            folds for unchanged text\nmarker          folds defined by markers in the text\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Personally I only use syntax folds.  Usually I just want to fold the method and not fold every indent level.  Inconsistent indenting and weirdly formatted legacy code at work often makes indent folding difficult or impossible.  Adding marks to the document is tedious and people who don't use Vim won't maintain them when they edit the document.  Manual folds work great until someone edits your code in source control and all your folds are now in the wrong place.  </p>\n\n<h1>More reading</h1>\n\n<ol>\n<li>See <code>:help fold-methods</code> to learn the details of different fold methods.</li>\n<li>See <code>:help folding</code> to learn the keyboard commands for manipulate folds.</li>\n<li>See <code>:help folds</code> for help on the entire topic of folding.</li>\n</ol>\n",

See note at the end.)</em></p>\n\n<p>If you're happy that your regex at the top is stripping away everything that you don't want to compare in your match, you don't need a substring match, and could do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>switch (base_url_string) {\n    case \"xxx.local\":\n        // Blah\n        break;\n    case \"xxx.dev.yyy.com\":\n        // Blah\n        break;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...but again, that only works if that's the <em>complete</em> string you're matching. It would fail if <code>base_url_string</code> were, say, \"yyy.xxx.local\" whereas your current code would match that in the \"xxx.local\" branch.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Okay, so technically you <em>can</em> use a <code>switch</code> for substring matching, but I wouldn't recommend it in most situations. Here's how (<a href=\"http://jsbin.com/ehabar\">live example</a>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>function test(str) {\n    switch (true) {\n      case /xyz/.test(str):\n        display(\"\u2022 Matched 'xyz' test\");\n        break;\n      case /test/.test(str):\n        display(\"\u2022 Matched 'test' test\");\n        break;\n      case /ing/.test(str):\n        display(\"\u2022 Matched 'ing' test\");\n        break;\n      default:\n        display(\"\u2022 Didn't match any test\");\n        break;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That works because of the way JavaScript <a href=\"http://es5.github.com/#x12.11\"><code>switch</code> statements work</a>, in particular two key aspects: First, that the cases are considered in <em>source text</em> order, and second that the selector expressions (the bits after the keyword <code>case</code>) are <em>expressions</em> that are evaluated as that case is evaluated (not constants as in some other languages). So since our test expression is <code>true</code>, the first <code>case</code> expression that results in <code>true</code> will be the one that gets used.</p>\n",

To avoid an exception error when accessing an array element of <code>null</code> we enclose the regexp into an optional capturing group.</p>\n\n<p>If the regexp fails, the output of <code>str.match(/(find)?/)[1]</code> will be <code>undefined</code>, otherwise it will obtain the matched value.</p>\n\n<pre><code>str = 'XYZ test';\nswitch (str) {\n  case str.match(/(^xyz)?/)[1]:\n    console.log(\"Matched a string that starts with 'xyz'\");\n    break;\n  case str.match(/(test)?/)[1]:\n    console.log(\"Matched the 'test' substring\");        \n    break;\n  default:\n    console.log(\"Didn't match\");\n    break;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Another approach is to use the <code>String()</code> constructor to convert the resulting array that has just 1 element to a string.

There's a little hackery in the fact that we temporarily override require, and only load our app code using require (our <code>`src_dir:</code> in <strong>jasmine.yml</strong> is empty), but the overall goal here is to reduce the overhead of writing a spec. </p>\n",

You can probably do it faster with Any+Time\u2122 than you could write out the time by hand--just try to find another picker you can say that about!  Not to mention, Any+Time\u2122 supports a countless variety of date/time formats, 12/24-hour clock, full CSS (or jQuery UI) customization and even time zones!</p>\n",

Basically, what swipe is - it's handling of touch down, touch move, touch up events. here is excerpt of my own lib for handling iPhone touch events:</p>\n\n<pre><code>touch_object.prototype.handle_touchstart = function(e){\n    if (e.targetTouches.length != 1){\n        return false;\n    }\n    this.obj.style.zIndex = 100;\n    e.preventDefault();\n    this.startX = e.targetTouches[0].pageX - this.geometry.x;\n    this.startY = e.targetTouches[0].pageY - this.geometry.y;\n    /* adjust for left /top */\n    this.bind_handler('touchmove');\n    this.bind_handler('touchend');\n}\ntouch_object.prototype.handle_touchmove = function(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    if (e.targetTouches.length != 1){\n        return false;\n    }\n    var x=e.targetTouches[0].pageX - this.startX;\n    var y=e.targetTouches[0].pageY - this.startY;\n    this.move(x,y);\n\n}\ntouch_object.prototype.handle_touchend = function(e){\n    this.obj.style.zIndex = 10;\n    this.unbind_handler('touchmove');\n    this.unbind_handler('touchend');\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I used that code to \"move things around\". But, instead of moving, you can create your own algorithm for e.g. triggering redirect to some other location, or you can use that move to \"move/swipe\" the element, on which the swipe is on to other location.</p>\n\n<p>so, it really helps to understand basics of how things work and then create more complicated solutions. this might help as well.</p>\n\n<p>I used this, to create my solution:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html\">http://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html</a></p>\n",

Another program, called \"the interpreter\", then examines \"something else\" and performs whatever actions are called for.   Depending on the language and its implementation, there are a variety of forms of \"something else\".  From more popular to less popular, \"something else\" might be</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Binary instructions for a virtual machine, often called <em>bytecode</em>, as is done in Lua, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, and many other systems (the approach was popularized in the 1970s by the UCSD P-system and UCSD Pascal)</p></li>\n<li><p>A tree-like representation of the original program, such as an abstract-syntax tree, as is done for many prototype or educational interpreters</p></li>\n<li><p>A tokenized representation of the source program, similar to Tcl</p></li>\n<li><p>The characters of the source program, as was done in MINT and TRAC</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One thing that complicates the issue is that <em>it is possible to translate (compile) bytecode into native machine instructions</em>.  Thus, a successful intepreted implementation might eventually acquire a compiler.  If the compiler runs dynamically, behind the scenes, it is often called a just-in-time compiler or JIT compiler.  JITs have been developed for Java, JavaScript, Lua, and I daresay  many other languages.  At that point you can have a hybrid implementation in which some code is interpreted and some code is compiled.</p>\n",

A quick google brought me to <a href=\"http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/manipulating-the-dom-with-jquery/229300630\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a>. When using jQ's <code>detach</code> method, a reference to the object is still kept in memory, so that could be causing your snapshot. </p>\n\n<p>Another thing could be that jQuery has a <code>div</code> node at hand, which is -obviously- kept in memory, but never added to the actual dom... a sort of <code>document.createNode('div')</code> without appending it. This, too, will show up in the memory snapshot. You can't get around this, jQuery uses it to parse strings into html elements. </p>\n\n<p>So to remove some elements from memory, <strike>use the jQuery <code>.remove()</code> method, and your mem will be cleared instantly</strike>.<em>cf Esailija's comment on why <code>remove</code> doesn't quite fit the bill here</em>.<br/> <code>$('#someElem')[0].parentNode.removeChild($('#someElem')[0]);</code> Should remove the element altogether, but might not unbind the events. Perhaps something along the lines of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#someElem').detach();//to remove any event listeners\n$('#someElem')[0].parentNode.removeChild($('#someElem')[0]);//remove element all together\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And, again, as Esailija pointed out in his answer, make sure that you assign references to any jQuery object (<code>var someRef= $('.someSelector');</code>) to a global variable, as they won't be GC'ed. Just avoid globals all together, in fact.<br/>\nBut to answer your question briefly, and clearly: no these aren't <em>real</em> memory leaks, the memory should be freed on the <code>onbeforeunload</code> event. The jQuery object is deleted, so all references go out of scope. At least, That's what my <em>\"research\"</em> lead me to believe. <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11186750/memory-leak-risk-in-javascript-closures\">Perhaps not entirely relevant, but just as a reference</a> Here's a question on mem-leaks I posted a while back, and with it a few things I found out..</p>\n",
