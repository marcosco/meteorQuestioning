It works fine (pixel-perfect column aligned) in Mozilla Firefox, Opera but not in Chrome 21.</p>\n\n<p>Solution:</p>\n\n<p>Like mentioned in this post <a href=\"http://datatables.net/forums/discussion/3835/width-columns-problem-in-chrome-safari/p1\">http://datatables.net/forums/discussion/3835/width-columns-problem-in-chrome-safari/p1</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Basically what is happening, is that DataTables is trying to read the\n  width of the table, that the browser has drawn, so it can make the\n  header match. The problem is that when DataTables does this\n  calculation on your page, the browser hasn't shown the scrollbar - and\n  hence the calculation is slightly wrong! The reason I suggest that\n  it's a Webkit bug, is that, even after DataTables has run through all\n  of it's logic, the scrollbar still hasn't been displayed. If you add\n  the following code you can see the effect of this:</p>\n  \n  <p>console.log( $(oTable.fnSettings().nTable).outerWidth() );\n      setTimeout( function () {\n      console.log( $(oTable.fnSettings().nTable).outerWidth() ); }, 1 );</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The interesting part is that after I added setTimeout and after it executed there was still one column not aligned. After adding \"sScrollX\": \"100%\",\n\"sScrollXInner\": \"100%\" all columns were aligned (pixel-perfect).</p>\n\n<p>Solution for Chrome/Chromium, works ofcource in FF, Opera, IE9:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).ready(function()\n{\n  var oTable = $('#mytable').dataTable(\n  {\n    \"sScrollY\":  ( 0.6 * $(window).height() ),\n    \"bPaginate\": false,\n    \"bJQueryUI\": true,\n    \"bScrollCollapse\": true,\n    \"bAutoWidth\": true,\n    \"sScrollX\": \"100%\",\n    \"sScrollXInner\": \"100%\"\n  });\n\n\n  setTimeout(function ()\n  {\n    oTable.fnAdjustColumnSizing();\n  }, 10 );\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n",

If I give the table's div (or a parent div somewhere higher up) a width at all, the headers don't line up properly.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thanks!!</p>\n\n<p>Screenshots:</p>\n\n<p>www.dennissheppard.net/firefox_alignment.png</p>\n\n<p>www.dennissheppard.net/chrome_alignment.png</p>\n\n<p>www.dennissheppard.net/ie7_alignment.png</p>\n\n<pre><code>otable = $('#order_review_grid').dataTable({                \n    'fnRowCallback': function (nRow, strings, displayIndex, dataIndex) {\n        return formatRow(nRow, dataIndex);\n    },\n    'fnDrawCallback':function()\n    {\n        checkIfOrderSubmitted(this);                    \n    },\n    'aoColumnDefs':\n    [\n        { 'bVisible': false, 'aTargets': [COL_PRODUCT] },\n        { 'bSortable': false, 'aTargets': [COL_IMAGE, COL_DELETE] },\n        { 'sClass': 'right_align', 'aTargets': [COL_PRICE] },\n        { 'sClass': 'center_align', 'aTargets': [COL_BRAND,COL_PACK] },\n        { 'sClass': 'left_align', 'aTargets': [COL_DESCRIPTION] }\n    ],\n    'sDom': 't',\n    'sScrollY':'405px',\n    'bScrollCollapse':true,\n    'aaSorting':[]\n});\n\n&lt;table id=\"order_review_grid\" class=\"grid_table\" cellpadding=\"0px\" cellspacing=\"0px\"&gt;                 \n    &lt;thead class=\"grid_column_header_row\" id=\"order_review_grid_column_header_row\"&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;td class=\"\" id='sequenceNumber'&gt;SEQ #&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td class=\"grid_sc_header\" id='statusCode'&gt;Sc&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td class=\"grid_sc_header\" id='onOrderGuide'&gt;O.G.&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td class=\"grid_image_header\" id='image'&gt;Image&lt;/td&gt;                         \n            &lt;td class=\"grid_description_header\" id='description'&gt;Description&lt;/td&gt;                           \n            &lt;td class=\"grid_brand_header\" id='label'&gt;Brand&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td class=\"grid_pack_header\" id='packSize'&gt;Pack&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td class=\"grid_price_header\" id='price'&gt;Price&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td class=\"grid_qtrfull_header\" id='caseQuantity'&gt;Full&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td class=\"grid_qtrypart_header\" id='eachQuantity'&gt;Partial&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td class=\"grid_refnum_header\" id='referenceNumber'&gt;Ref #&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td class=\"grid_refnum_header\"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;/thead&gt;\n    &lt;tbody class=\"\"&gt;\n        &lt;!-- loaded data will go here --&gt;\n    &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre>\n",

Like JQuery, GWT \"normalizes\" the browsers for you, so you typically don't have to user-agent checks or anything.  What the Java IDE goodness gets you is really reliable refactoring support for changing Names, Packaging, Method Signatures, all kinds of stuff.  ITS BEEN 2 YEARS SINCE I'VE DONE GWT, but I think its downside, especially on large projects, is the compile step.  It is not fast, especially when you let it loose to compile all the Java for each of the browsers.  If I recall correctly, and if it still does this today, it produces on really big JavaScript file for each of IE, FireFox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari.  That takes time, my friend.  There is a unit testing framework in there as well which is interesting, albeit slower than its pure Java counterpart.</p>\n\n<p>GWT Benefit:  Robust Tool support via Java IDE ecosystem.\nGWT Liability:  Compile time</p>\n\n<p>I don't know nearly as much about JQuery other than it too seems to have cracked the browser compatibility cookie allowing you, fair developer, to concentrate on your application.  What I do know about JQuery is that it seems to have developer mindshare.  I, who am no JavaScript expert, managed to integrate JQuery into my Java webapp and add an image preview \"plug-in\" called imgPreview (http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/new-jquery-plugin-imgpreview/) giving pop-up image previews to my bland table-based UI in about 30 minutes one afternoon.  The browsers have grown up too in the last 2 years such that you can now dynamically debug your JavaScript in realtime in the console (Chrome rocks for this, but it is essentially the same in FireFox and Safari), as well as tweak the styles and do all kind of straight DOM manipulation.</p>\n\n<p>JQuery benefit:  Straight up JavaScript with no interpretation and developer mindshare\nJQuery liability:  It is challenging to refactor JavaScript at anywhere near the level of a Java application.</p>\n\n<p>My 2 cents worth.</p>\n",

For these web-sites you usually have a good backend (Grails, Spring MVC) which takes care of flow synchronisation and the JS framework is just responsible for making the UI more interactive and for some UI changes.   </p>\n\n<p>An example for this kind of web-sites is stackoverflow. If you click on a link it will load a new HTML page. If you click on your inbox link it will use jQuery to open a popup and retrieve your notifications and display them.   </p>\n\n<p>Google Closure is probably closer to jQuery than to GWT. I think the biggest selling point of Google Closure are the client- and server-side HTML templates. I don't have much experience with Google Closure but it is heavily used by Google for their web-apps. </p>\n\n<p>Because I have worked mostly with GWT here is a list of advantages and dis-advantages I can think of regarding GWT:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Robust toolkit</li>\n<li>Development tools (testing, refactoring, eclipse, live-debugging)</li>\n<li>Cross browser compatibility out of the box (with some caveats)</li>\n<li>Availability of third party libraries (DTO serialization, MVP frameworks, etc)</li>\n<li>Only code which is used is downloaded to the client (with JS frameworks you download the whole framework even if you only use one specific function)</li>\n<li>GWT-RPC and RequestFactory for communication with a JAVA backend (no need to serialize or de-serialize yourself). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bigger learning curve  </li>\n<li>Might not be suited for small UI enhancements   </li>\n<li>Compilation can take some time if code base is big and different browser and languages must be supported</li>\n<li>Generated Javascript can become big in complex applications (solution: code splitting)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As a side-note: with each new GWT version the disadvantages become less of an issue as each new GWT version improves in compilation time and code size. <a href=\"http://blog.oio.de/2011/12/08/future-of-gwt-and-gwt-2-5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GWT 2.5</a> is supposed to have some really good enhancements in this area. </p>\n\n<p>To summarize: if you want to develop a desktop like interactive web-application I think GWT is probably your best choice.<br>\nHowever if you want to develop a more traditional \"web 2.0ish\" web-site jQuery/Google Closure might be a better solution. </p>\n",

                    "body": "<h3>Cubic splines</h3>\n\n<p>If you want to draw lines <i>through</i> points, then you want interpolation. Beziers are cubic curves with off-curve control nodes, but a cubic spline is a set of cubic curves through n points, with smooth changes from each to the next. See the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_spline\">Wikipedia article</a> for more detail on the maths.</p>\n\n<p>To construct a cubic spline through a set of points, you unfortunately have to perform an iterative procedure; you are essentially making n-1 cubic curves and matching their parameters together, which gives you n+1 simultaneous equations to solve. Once you have done that once, as you move the points you can use your previous solution as a starting point.</p>\n\n<p>To do this in Raphael you'll need to generate the cubic spline, then calculate the equivalent Bezier control values for each segment. </p>\n\n<p>There are pieces of javascript out there to calculate cubic splines for you, for example\n<a href=\"http://blog.mackerron.com/2011/01/javascript-cubic-splines/\">Cubic splines in JavaScript (via CoffeeScript)</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Piecewise polynomial</h3>\n\n<p>An alternative to cubic splines is to fit a cubic (or higher) polynomial to each set of a few points; e.g. cubic to each 4 points, <i>including overlaps</i>. So points 10-13 make the cubic for the line from 11 to 12. It will not be as smooth as a cubic spline, but it should be much closer. This is pretty similar to cubic spline, but without equation solve for the curve parameters to make everything smooth.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with piecewise polynomial is that it uses higher order polynomials, which are unstable, and you can get large kinks and wiggles when the points don't lie on polynomial lines or when the points are close together.</p>\n\n<p>To draw this in Raphael you are probably best just sampling the line more frequently and using straight lines to draw it.</p>\n\n<h3>Line shape</h3>\n\n<p>One big consideration is what kind of line you want to draw. If you just want a smooth line, do cubic spline. But if you are drawing statistics or some other specific kind of line you may be better off looking into gaussian decomposition or other things: Cubic splines are cubic polynomials (ax<sup>3</sup> + bx<sup>2</sup> + cx + d = 0), so you cannot approximate sine curves very well (audio/signals), or Gaussians (signals/statistics), or exponentials (decay curves, long tail statistics).</p>\n",

It seems extremely helpful - the setter is a kind of 'helper' which can parse the value to be set first, before actually setting it.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I currently have this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var obj = function(value) {\n    var test = !!value; // 'test' has to be a boolean\n    return {\n        get test() { return test },\n        set test(value) { test = !!value }\n    };\n};\n\nvar instance = new obj(true);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code always converts <code>value</code> to a boolean. So if you code <code>instance.test = 0</code>, then <code>instance.test === false</code>.</p>\n\n<p>However, for this to work you have to actually return an <strong>object</strong>, which means that the new instance is not of type <code>obj</code> but just is a plain object. This means that changing the prototype of <code>obj</code> has no effect on instances. For example, this does <strong>not</strong> work - <code>instance.func</code> is undefined:</p>\n\n<pre><code>obj.prototype.func = function() { console.log(this.value); };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>because <code>instance</code> is not of type <code>obj</code>. To get the prototype functions work, I guess I should not return a plain object, but rather not return anything so that <code>instance</code> would just be of type <code>obj</code>, like a regular constructor works.</p>\n\n<p>The problem then is how to implement getters/setters? I can only find articles describing how to add these to an object, not as being part of the constructor of a custom type.</p>\n\n<p>So how do I implement getters/setters in the constructor so as to be able to both use getters/setters and extending the prototype?</p>\n",

It will inject into the HTML <code>&lt;script type='application/x-suppress'&gt;</code> between the close script tag of first.js and the open script tag of second.js.</p>\n\n<p>The parser will see this and start a new script element. Because the type attribute has a value which is not one that the browser recognises as being JavaScipt, it will not attempt to run its content. (So there are an infinite number of possible type attribute values you could use here, but you must include a type attribute, as in it's absence, the browser will assume that the script's content is JavaScript.)</p>\n\n<p>The second.js script's opening tag will then be parsed as text content of the new script element and not executed. Finally the second.js script's closing tag will be re-purposed to close the new script element instead, which means that the remainder of the HTML is parsed correctly.</p>\n\n<p>You can see a working version at <a href=\"http://www.alohci.net/static/jsprevent/jsprevent.htm\">http://www.alohci.net/static/jsprevent/jsprevent.htm</a></p>\n",

I have also whited out the name of the external JavaScript file, and all that remains is .js (sorry, but I'm just trying to be careful :) ) I cut off some of the screenshot, so the text would be large enough to read.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/j8pSR.png\" alt=\"Chrome Screenshot\"></p>\n\n<p>As you can see by the screenshot, the request processes OK for the first three requests. Then I \"sleep\"ed my device and then turned my device back on. That's where the next two requests are errors (in red). After these first two errors, the requests begin to process normally again (rows with black text, after rows with red text). The console clearly shows the error message.</p>\n",

Even worst : if I use <strong>fiddler</strong> to monitor HTTP traffic... it <strong>also works</strong>. Whereas there seems to be no connection at all without fiddler, as detailed in the API's specs. (See below.)</p>\n\n<p>Judging by <a href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/network.html#the-websocket-interface\">this</a>, the exception should also appear on Chrome/Firefox... but it does not. So I doubt it has anything related to HTTP/HTTPS. In anycase, I am using a wsS socket on a httpS page... Moreover : when I replace the wss address by another valid server found on an online example, it works.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if this is relevant, but the IP from test.dev.mydomain.net is 10.14.x.x where hello.dev.mydomain.net is 194.247.x.x . I don't know if it could trigger some kind of security on IE only...</p>\n\n<p>One (more ?) last thing : I have a certificate for *.dev.mydomain.net, IE does not seems to have problems with it. The script originaly resides on a server called my.name.dev.mydomain.net but since I am accessing it from another URL (I got a redirect since we first thought it could have been some kind of Same Origin Policy issue) I don't see how it could matter. At least I hope it does not...</p>\n\n<p>Any idea is welcomed.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT : adding the sites to the trusted zone does not work either.</p>\n",

There can only be 1 primary contact, so when the primary contact is set to true on a record I have javascript code that loops through the datasource and sets any other contacts set as primary to false.</p>\n\n<p>The javascript all fires fine and the data fields are set correctly but there are two problems:\n1. The grid is not updated with the changes I make under the hood to the datasource\n2. The records changed are not marked as \"dirty\" and therefore not sync'd back when I call a Datasource.sync()</p>\n\n<p>I can fix the second issue by manually setting the dirty field on the record, but this doesnt seem right.

To do this, you could modify typescript.js by adding:</p>\n\n<pre><code>module.exports = exports = TypeScript;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Right at the end of the file.</p>\n\n<p>Then, you can create an index.js file in the root of the module (notice: install the module in a local scope for all of this: \"npm install typescript\"), which exposes the object.</p>\n\n<pre><code>exports.TypeScript = require(\"bin/typescript\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And ready! Now you can just call it and compile your code using it. You can check how to use the API for compilation in the tsc.js file.</p>\n\n<p>I apologize in advance for the horrible code ahead:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var fs = require(\"fs\");\nvar TypeScript = require(\"typescript\");\nvar path = \"test.ts\";\nvar pathout = \"test.js\";\nvar content = fs.readFileSync(path, \"utf-8\");\nvar fd = fs.openSync(pathout, 'w'); \nvar outFile = { \n    Write: function (str) { \n        fs.writeSync(fd, str); \n    }, \n    WriteLine: function (str) {\n    console.log(fd, str); \n        fs.writeSync(fd, str + '\\r\\n'); \n    }, \n    Close: function () { \n        fs.closeSync(fd); \n        fd = null; \n    } \n};\nvar createFile = function (path) { \n    function mkdirRecursiveSync(path) { \n        var stats = fs.statSync(path); \n        if(stats.isFile()) { \n            throw \"\\\"\" + path + \"\\\" exists but isn't a directory.\"; \n        } else { \n            if(stats.isDirectory()) { \n                return; \n            } else { \n                mkdirRecursiveSync(_path.dirname(path)); \n                fs.mkdirSync(path, 509); \n            } \n        } \n    } \n    mkdirRecursiveSync(_path.dirname(path));\n    console.log(path) \n    var fd = fs.openSync(path, 'w'); \n    return { \n        Write: function (str) { \n            fs.writeSync(fd, str); \n        }, \n        WriteLine: function (str) { \n            fs.writeSync(fd, str + '\\r\\n'); \n        }, \n        Close: function () { \n            fs.closeSync(fd); \n            fd = null; \n        } \n    }; \n};\nvar stderr = { \n    Write: function (str) { \n        process.stderr.write(str); \n    }, \n    WriteLine: function (str) { \n        process.stderr.write(str + '\\n'); \n    }, \n    Close: function () { \n    } \n}\nvar compiler = new TypeScript.TypeScriptCompiler(outFile, outFile);\ncompiler.setErrorOutput(stderr);\ncompiler.addUnit(content, path);\ncompiler.typeCheck();\ncompiler.emit(false, createFile);\noutFile.Close();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For some reason whoever wrote the code was a real fan of C# and proceeded to go ahead and use methods called WriteLine, Close and Write, which are in fact just wrappers. You could get this of the overhead of having to add this functions, but you would have to modify a lot of code in the module and it isn't worth it. I think it is best to have a class to extend (or if you are still on JS, inherit the prototype) and let it do that for you, to make it DRY.</p>\n\n<p>Something really nice is that if you want to translate 500 TypeScript files and put them all into a single .js file, you can just call compiler.addUnit(anothercontent, anotherpath); 500 times and then see it all go into a single file :)</p>\n\n<p>Focusing on better things: if you check tsc.js code, you will find a batch compiler class. If you want this for a build process, it might be better to use something more robust like it. It provides watching files and more.</p>\n\n<p>Having browsed the code, I think I will just submit a ticket to the development team and ask them to provide a clearer API \u00ac\u00ac</p>\n\n<p>Note: All file reads in here are done in a synchronous way. This is bad, very bad, in terms of performance. I don't know exactly what you plan to do, but I couldn't recommend more that you find a way to make this async if possible. </p>\n",

When not passing any arguments, JS will start by scanning the arguments object for any of the given arguments, when those are undefined, The <code>arguments</code> prototype chain will be scanned, all the way up to <code>Object.prototype</code>. If those all lack the desired property, JS will return <code>undefined</code>. Whereas, passing undefined explicitly, sets it as a property directly on the arguments object:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function foo(arg)\n{\n    console.log(arguments.hasOwnProperty('0'));\n}\nfoo();//false'\nfoo('bar');//true\nfoo(undefined);//true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I gather that's the reason why passing undefined explicitly tends to be faster.</p>\n",

It's fairly easy for it to determine that there are no side effects, because the function simply references its parameter values and returns the result of a simple expression. Since the return value is ignored, there's no reason for the runtime to do anything at all.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that, if the code were:</p>\n\n<pre><code>something += threeArgs(1, 2, 3);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the optimizer might decide to generate code roughly equivalent to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>something += 6;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Why? Because the call was made with numeric constants, and it can safely fold those at code generation time. It might be conservative on that, because numbers are weird, but here they're all integers so it could well do this. Even if it didn't, it could safely inline the function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>something += 1 + 2 + 3;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When there's a parameter missing, however, it may be that the optimizers bail out and generate a real function call. For such a simple function, the overhead of the function call could easily account for a large difference in performance.</p>\n\n<p>By using variables instead of constants in a test, and by actually using the return value of the function, you can \"confuse\" the optimizer and keep it from skipping the call or pre-computing the result, but you can't keep it from inlining.  I still think that your result is interesting for that reason: it exposes the fact that (as of today anyway) those optimizers are sensitive to the way that functions are invoked.</p>\n",

                    "body": "<h2>Short asnwer: Function execution queueing</h2>\n\n<p>This is the short answer to your question. <code>setTimeout</code> with either 0 or 1 millisecond is used for function execution queueing. Read on to find out why and how.</p>\n\n<h2>Javascript has single threaded execution</h2>\n\n<p>Javascript engine is a single threaded process. So whenever developers wanted to defer some function execution to get executed right after the current one that's just being executed, a <code>setTimeout</code> is being used to actually <strong>queue the next function</strong>... It doesn't have anything to do directly with events although functions may be event handlers. The only event in this equation is the timeout event that setTimeout creates.</p>\n\n<p>This is an example of two functions where the first function during its execution queues a second function to be executed right after it. </p>\n\n<pre><code>function first()\n{\n    // does whatever it needs to\n\n    // something else needs to be executed right afterwards\n    setTimeout(second, 1);\n\n    // do some final processing and exit\n    return;\n}\n\nfunction second()\n{\n    // whatever needs to be done\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So to javascript engine thread the execution queue looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>first()\nsecond()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Mind that this has <strong>nothing to do with function call stack</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Why 1ms?</h2>\n\n<p>1ms is a very short amount of time, which (almost) assures that your second function will get executed right after your first function returns. You may see sometimes even <strong>0ms</strong> which actually executes it <strong>right after first function returns</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If one would on the other hand use longer time i.e. 100ms this could result in a different function getting executed in the meantime and that could have an undesired effect on the whole UI process.</p>\n\n<h2>Why function queueing in the first place?</h2>\n\n<p>Browsers nowadays prevent client side functionality to hang current browser session by observing long running functions. If a particular function runs long enough, browser Javascript execution engine will pause it and ask the user whether they want to terminate it (kill it) or wait for it to complete.</p>\n\n<p>This is usually undesired effect when you actually do have a long running function. For instance imagine you have a function that has to loop through a large number of items processing each one during the process. You definitely don't want the user to terminate the process because the loop needs to execute.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's the solution</strong> in this case? In such case instead of having a single function with loop and executing it, you'd rather have the loop (queueing) function that would then queue function calls for processing each item. This is just an outer skeleton of such functionality.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function queueItems(items) {\n    for(var i = 0; i &lt; items.length, i++)\n    {\n        setTimeout((function(item) {\n            return function() {\n                processItem(item);\n            };\n        })(items[i]), 0);\n    }\n}\n\nfunction processItem(item) {\n    // process individual item\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This way you'd prevent your functions to run too long and after each executed function control would get back to Javascript engine <em>resetting its function-hang timer</em>. But be aware that while your functions are being executed your UI will likely be unresponsive or at most unpredictable. It may be better to queue your function with some time space in between so UI stays responsive if that's desired.</p>\n",

                    "body": "<p>I think most of your questions can be clarified by understanding the real purpose of WebSockets. WebSockets was not primarily designed to replace any of the the things that are already in place and working well. For example, it was not designed to be a low-overhead version of AJAX. The purpose is to provide a bidirectional, low latency, full duplex, communication channel between the browser and server. It's real purpose is to enable a new domain of web applications or to improve current ones that are abusing HTTP to achieve bidirectional communication.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind let me comment on your bullet points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The purpose of periodic WebSockets ping/pong messages is two-fold: to keep the channel from being closed by TCP timeout and to more quickly detect when the channel is closed (this is historically a weakness of TCP). The purpose of HTTP/AJAX polling is to get around the fact that HTTP is not bidirectional (i.e. the client polls to give the server the opportunity to send data back). WebSocket ping/pong frames are generally 2 bytes long. HTTP/AJAX polling requires full headers, cookies, etc which can easily total over a kilobyte for each request/response. Even if you send a ping/pong 10 times a second over WebSockets you are still unlikely to even compare to the overhead of HTTP/AJAX polling every 2 seconds. However, note that applications do not have the ability to send ping/pong messages. This is between the browser and server.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you lose the Internet connection, you will receive an onclose event. If your browser is not doing ping/pong messages for you then you may not receive an onclose until you try to send a message after the network connection goes down.</p></li>\n<li><p>I wouldn't replace a working RESTful service with WebSockets. You would be doing a lot of mapping work for probably very little benefit (again, WebSockets is not designed to replace what's already working well). I can envision situations where you might have a combination of both: REST for state transfer, WebSockets for event notification. E.g. the server sends a WebSocket message indicating \"something changed\" which triggers the client to do a REST request to find out the change.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Clarification: you could do REST over WebSockets but it's a mismatch in philosophy. REST is an architecture style that is un-opinionated about the underlying transport system. It is a constrained architecture: \"client-server\", \"stateless\", \"cacheable\", \"layered system\", \"code on demand\", and \"uniform interface\". WebSockets is constrained by none of those; it is a generic message transport system. You could constrain WebSockets to be RESTful but don't do that until you understand both REST and WebSockets intimately and can identify when it's right to do so.</p>\n",

Websockets is a really cool technology, but I also find it frustratingly unpredictable - which is probably just me being a novice and making some mistakes.  If I had more of the bugs worked out I might have put a link, but it crashes too much, so I don't have it on a live server at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose that would qualify it as a NON-production-ready app, but hypothetically I don't see why someone else with more experience wouldn't have already done it well.</p>\n",

And before i will start using them in my app i just want the community to answer these questions:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...in order to maintain presence, the app can send keep-alive messages on the WebSocket to prevent it from being closed due to an idle timeout...\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"...ideally a future version of WebSocket will support timeout discovery, so it can either tell the application the period for keep-alive messages...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>This feels like deja vu. Earlier we had to poll the server once a %period_time% to get the needed updated information. With websockets we have to poll the websocket server once a %period_time% with <strong>keep-alive messages</strong> to make sure the internet connection is still alive / the websocket server is still working. What's the profit?</p>\n\n<p>And another thing regarding these keep-alive messages. Websocket protocol has an advantage of using less traffic than HTTP(S). If we send keep-alive messages, it seems like the traffic advantage dissapears. Or maybe not?</p></li>\n<li><p>How should i handle the <strong>loss of internet</strong> in my app if i use websockets? I mean the real situation when the internet connection is suddenly lost (i mean no \"navigator.offline\" event has happened). Should i use some kind of setTimeout-function to look for keep-alive messages or is there a better way to handle this situation?</p></li>\n<li><p>REST gives us a clear understanding of how an app should work and how the requests should look like. What's the best way of doing this in websocket-powered apps? Should i just have (say) JSON-encoded messages with request.action field it it? And how should the app perform PUT-requests? There are URL-resources in REST model to handle this, so should i use combination of these approaches or maybe is there smth simplier?</p></li>\n</ol>\n",

It appears that this can happen even when the image is considered to be fully loaded; I am not familiar enough with this part of the code to know why that might be.</p>\n\n<p>It is my opinion as an occasional Firefox internals hacker that you have found a bug in the browser: the <a href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#dom-context-2d-drawimage\">specification for drawImage</a> does not license the production of an exception with this error code under any circumstances.

The HTTP/1.1 specification suggests that browsers download no more than two components in parallel per hostname. If you serve your images from multiple hostnames, you can get more than two downloads to occur in parallel. While a script is downloading, however, the browser won't start any other downloads, even on different hostnames.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In some situations it's not easy to move scripts to the bottom. If, for example, the script uses document.write to insert part of the page's content, it can't be moved lower in the page. There might also be scoping issues. In many cases, there are ways to workaround these situations.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>An alternative suggestion that often comes up is to use deferred scripts. The DEFER attribute indicates that the script does not contain document.write, and is a clue to browsers that they can continue rendering. Unfortunately, Firefox doesn't support the DEFER attribute. In Internet Explorer, the script may be deferred, but not as much as desired. If a script can be deferred, it can also be moved to the bottom of the page. That will make your web pages load faster.</em></p>\n",

This is (arguably) a bug in Java and Javascript. Even if one manages through casuistry or obstinacy to argue that it is <em>not</em> a bug, it's sure a big gotcha.   Kinda bites, really. </p>\n\n<p>The problem is that those popular regex shortcuts <em>only</em> apply to 7-bit ASCII whether in Java or in Javascript. This restriction is painfully 1970s\u2010ish; it  makes absolutely no sense in the 21\u02e2\u1d57 century. This <a href=\"http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/fixing-javascript-regexp\">blog posting</a> from this past March makes a good argument for fixing this problem in Javascript.</p>\n\n<p>It would be <strong>really nice</strong> if some public-spirited soul would please add Javascript to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_regular_expression_engines\">this Wikipedia page</a> that compares the support regex features in various languages. </p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.regular-expressions.info/unicode.html#prop\">page</a> says that Javascript doesn't support any Unicode properties at all. That same site has <a href=\"http://www.regular-expressions.info/refflavors.html\">a table</a> that's a lot more detailed than the Wikipedia page I mention above. For Javascript features, look under its ECMA column.  </p>\n\n<p>However, that table is in some cases at least five years out of date, so I can't completely vouch for it.  It's a good start, though.</p>\n\n<h2>Unicode Support in Other Languages</h2>\n\n<p>Ruby, Python, Perl, and PCRE all offer ways to extend <code>\\w</code> to mean what it is <em>supposed</em> to mean, but the two J\u2010thingies do not. </p>\n\n<p>In Java, however, there <em>is</em> a good workaround available.  There, you can use <code>\\pL</code> to mean any character that has the Unicode General_Category=Letter property. That means you can always emulate a proper <code>\\w</code> using <code>[\\pL\\p{Nd}_]</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, there's even an advantage to writing it that way, because it keeps you aware that you're adding decimal numbers and the underscore character to the character class. With a simple <code>\\w</code>, please sometimes forget this is going on. </p>\n\n<p>I don't believe that this workaround is available in Javascript, though. You can also use Unicode properties like those in Perl and PCRE, and in Ruby 1.9, but not in Python. </p>\n\n<p>The only Unicode properties current Java supports are the one- and two-character general properties like <code>\\pN</code> and <code>\\p{Lu}</code> and the block properties like <code>\\p{InAncientSymbols}</code>, but not scripts like <code>\\p{IsGreek}</code>, etc. </p>\n\n<p>The future JDK7 will finally get around to adding scripts. Even then Java still won't support most of the Unicode properties, though, not even critical ones like <code>\\p{WhiteSpace}</code> or handy ones like <code>\\p{Dash}</code> and <code>\\p{Quotation_Mark}</code>.  </p>\n\n<p><em><strong>SIGH!</em></strong> To understand just how limited Java's property support is, merely compare it with Perl. Perl supports 1633 Unicode properties as of 2007's 5.10 release, and 2478 of them as of this year's 5.12 release.  I haven't counted them for ancient releases, but Perl started supporting Unicode properties back during the last millennium. </p>\n\n<p>Lame as Java is, it's still better than Javascript, because Javascript doesn't support any Unicode properties whatso*<em>CENSORED</em>*ever.  I'm afraid that <a href=\"http://devedge-temp.mozilla.org/library/manuals/2000/javascript/1.5/guide/ident.html#1009568\">Javascript's paltry 7-bit mindset</a> makes it pretty close to unusable for Unicode. This is a tremendously huge gaping hole in the language that's extremely difficult to account for given its target domain.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry 'bout that. \u2639</p>\n",

Having no more qualified advice, I have a crazy workaround to offer you: Howzabout you present the applet on a different page, and dynamically create an <code>IFRAME</code> to show that page in the space your applet should occupy? IFRAMEs are a bit more consistent in syntax across browsers, and I'd be surprised if they were to fail the same way.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you should use your browser's debugging tools to look at the DOM after you swap in your applet node.

That means any state carried in A will be found on all instances of B. The moment you do an assignment to that property on an instance of B, you have effectively replaced what that instance (and only that instance) points to (I believe this is due to the fact there is a new property \"name\" on B that gets hit in the scope chain, before it reaches the \"name\" implementation on A).</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>To give a more explicit example of whats going on:</p>\n\n<pre><code>B.prototype = new A();\nvar obj1 = new B();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, the first time we do a read, the intepreter does something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>obj1.name;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Interpreter: \"I need property name.  First, check B.  B does not have 'name', so lets continue down the scope chain.  Next up, A.  Aha! A has 'name', return that\"</p>\n\n<p>However, when you do a write, the interpreter doesn't actually care about the inherited property.</p>\n\n<pre><code>obj1.name = \"Fred\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Interpreter:  \"I need to assign to property 'name'.  I'm within the scope of this <em>instance</em> of B, so assign 'Fred' to B.  But I leave everything else farther down the scope chain alone (i.e., A)\"</p>\n\n<p>Now, next time you do a read...</p>\n\n<pre><code>obj1.name;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Interpreter:  \"I need property 'name'.  Aha! this <em>instance</em> of B has the property 'name' already sitting on it.  Just return that - I don't care about the rest of the scope chain (i.e. A.name)\"</p>\n\n<p>So, the first time you write to name, it inserts it as a first class property on the instance, and doesn't care anymore about what is on A.  A.name is <em>still there</em>, it's just further down the scope chain, and the JS interpreter doesn't get that far before it found what it was looking for.</p>\n\n<p>If \"name\" had a default value in A (as you have, which is \"A\"), then you would see this behaviour:</p>\n\n<pre><code>B.prototype = new A();\nvar obj1 = new B();\nvar obj2 = new B();\n\nobj1.name = \"Fred\";\n\nalert(obj1.name); // Alerts Fred\nalert(obj2.name); // Alerts \"A\", your original value of A.name\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, in the case of your array, you never actually <em>replaced</em> list on the scope chain with a new array.  What you did is grab a handle on the array itself, and added an element to it.  Hence, all instances of B are affected.  </p>\n\n<p>Interpreter: \"I need to get the 'list' propery, and add an element to it.  Checking this instance of B ... nope, does not have a 'list' property.  Next in the scope chain: A.  Yep, A has 'list', use that.

You will be able to parallelize the tests across multiple browsers. Of course, these browsers don't have to run on the same machine so you will be able to use multiple machines too.</p>\n\n<p>I don't think running multiple instances of Karma itself would help that much, as it is written in a very \"non-blocking\" way and I haven't seen it to be the bottleneck. We should however optimize the CPU/memory usage. A lot of improvements in this area is coming in v0.12.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>running only a subset of tests:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You should totally use <code>iit</code>/<code>ddescribe</code> (Jasmine). Any reason why this does not work for you? Btw. Mocha's implementation of <code>it.only()</code> and <code>describe.only()</code> has issues, so I recommend Jasmine (or fixing Mocha).</p>\n\n<p>There is also a prototype of Google Closure <a href=\"https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-closure\">plugin</a> which only loads the files you really need (say you <code>iit</code> one test, it will only load/parse/evaluate the files you really need for that <code>iit</code>). This improves start time on huge projects significantly - we should do similar tricks for other module loaders (RequireJS, CommonJS).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>write faster code:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You probably know this already... ;-)</p>\n\n<p>DOM is slow. A good separation of logic/DOM will allow you to test more stuff without actually touching DOM. If you use Angular, you might check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/vojtajina/ng-directive-testing\">testing directives example</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Using Dependency Injection pattern helps a lot as you basically minimize the environment you need to prepare (and also tear down) for each test. Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/vojtajina/testability-interview\">an example</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In general, lower lower tests are faster. I think it's good to cover each functionality/issue with lowest possible test.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>eliminate memory leaks:</strong></p>\n\n<p>If your tests leak memory, the browser will get slower and slower and so the test number 1000 will be pretty slow even though it's well written. Make sure each test frees up all the references. You can use <code>http://localhost:9876/debug.html</code> and profile the memory. Check the memory before executing (after Jasmine executed all the <code>describe()</code> blocks and collected the tests) and then after executing the tests - it should be the same.</p>\n\n<p>Finding some memory leaks is harder than others, but it can significantly improve the speed - I've seen stuff like from ~5mins to under a minute just by eliminating memory leaks.</p></li>\n</ul>\n",

E.g. REST data backends using AJAX.</p>\n\n<p>It is well observed on the Internet that Chrome (and Webkit friends) do not handle HTTP authentication prompts when such a resource demands it. E.g. [2]\n( this is to prevent the browser showing an auth login dialog on for example, a Web-Mail sign-in page when an image tags load fails with a 401 and needs credentials.  The user may be duped in to entering their webmail credentials)</p>\n\n<p>Chrome's behaviour in this situation is to drop the response, cancelling the request almost silently.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, Chrome will only let the response through normally if a 200 occurs; any other status code is swallowed and the AJAX call is aborted.</p>\n\n<p>If one uses jQuery to perform an Ajax request, and the remote site responds with an HTTP 401 status code, the request is cancelled and the ajax completes with an error, but the 401 code is missing.  It as if the connection died or a equivalent lower layer problem.</p>\n\n<p><em>The only website I've seen which mentions this caveat of CORS specifically is [1]</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Browers don't do a good job of reporting what went wrong when there is an error. \n  For example, Firefox reports a status of 0 and an empty statusText for all errors. \n  Browsers also report an error message to the console log, \n  but this message cannot be accessed from JavaScript. \n  When handling onerror, you will know that an error occurred, but not much else.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can disable this security by using a chrome startup flag - just to test both the backend is functioning 'normally' and one sanity hasn't been unduly affected by the loss of proper status codes. See [2]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>\n\n<p>What if the backend and front-end client code is supposed to use the 401 as part of it's authentication process? - any failures are just just mangled into one \"error\" output. </p>\n\n<p>For example: Upon issuing a request to authenticate - e.g. 2-legged OAuth token request -against a RESTful backend - which uses proper status codes - The client has no idea if: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>401</strong> The user was not authenticated.</li>\n<li><strong>---</strong> The connection failed.</li>\n<li><strong>400</strong> There was a bad request.</li>\n<li><strong>500</strong> The server has a problem.</li>\n<li><strong>207</strong> There was no content after success.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A backend of ours which was written <em>quite</em> RESTfully, following as many best practices as was deemed cost effective at the time; one of these was relying on proper HTTP status codes. \nThe Java REST Client we have working against has worked great.</p>\n\n<p>Now I have begun creating a Javascript client, for embedding in webpages - specifically using CORS, and we have hit the problem in Chrome etc. (Note Firefox <em>seems</em> fine, and we generally don't care for IE at present.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question</strong></p>\n\n<p>What have people done to work around these issues?<br>\nIs there anything that can be done to make CORS more suitable for trusted backends?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Links</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>CORS Tutorial: <a href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/\">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/</a></li>\n<li>Chrome won't allow 401-triggered auth prompt for resources: <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=81251\">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=81251</a></li>\n<li>--disable-web-security for Chrome: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3102819/chrome-disable-same-origin-policy\">Chrome: Disable same origin policy</a></li>\n</ol>\n",

However the problem is that <em>only</em> gives you the textual errors, it does not give you any context as to what part of the model gave you those errors. So I have made a small change to the source to now pass back the observable tied to each error, as this may be useful for a few scenarios, but from here I need to be able to tie this to an element so I can display some in-line validation of some kind.</p>\n\n<p>Knockout Validation provides a very basic in-line validation where it creates a span after your element and you can give it a class, but this is too basic for my needs as currently we are using Qtip and other notification systems to display validation errors, and because of this I need to be able to have a Dom element and an error. So far I have an observable and an error, but I need to tie that observable object (which could be any ko.observable() property from the model) to its given DOM element, if it does have an element binding.</p>\n\n<p>As all I have is an object and I am using validation driven from the model not the UI, the problem is not really going to be solved via a custom binding. Ideally I need to be able to crack open the marry up the observable object (an unknown <code>ko.observable()</code>) to an element.</p>\n\n<p>Not to go too project specific, but my current project abstracts validation where events are fired off (i.e <code>EventSystem.SendEvent(ValidationEvents.ValidationFailed, &lt;element&gt;, &lt;error&gt;)</code>) then a validation system listens for these events and ties the error to the element, be it a tooltip, a growl style notification, an alert box etc. So I am trying to find the best way to keep this abstraction when driving the validation from the models observables not the ui's DOM elements (i.e jquery-ui)</p>\n\n<p>== Edit 2 ==</p>\n\n<p>I was a bit thrown by the way Knockout Validation knows the elements for observables to put in its own validation elements, however they just piggy back off the existing value binding, so I am just going to change that to add the elements for any validation elements based on their <code>isValidatable()</code> method, at least that way for each error I can tie it to an observable, and for any observables with element bindings I can tie them to the elements, and if there are none then it is fine they would just be form wide validation errors. I will give this a try as this should be something like (not tested yet):</p>\n\n<pre><code>if(utils.isValidatable(valueAccessor())) {\n    valueAccessor().extend({hasElementalBinding: true, elementalBinding: element});\n}\nelse { \n    valueAccessor().extend({hasElementalBinding: false});\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At around line 250 in the <code>registerValueBindingHandler</code>, I will leave this question open for a while longer incase someone else has a better solution.</p>\n",

The request you posted above looks like the preflight request, since it is uses the HTTP OPTIONS method. So the first thing you have to do is verify that your server accepts OPTIONS requests (I believe this should just work, but it may explain why you are receiving a 403).</p>\n\n<p>Next, you need a valid preflight response. The response to a preflight request must also contain the following two headers:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin,cache-control,content-type,man,messagetype,soapaction\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(See how these response headers are an echo of the Access-Control-Request-Method and Access-Control-Request-Headers request headers). The Access-Control-Allow-Headers header should contain any custom request headers.</p>\n\n<p>Once the browser receives this response, it knows that the preflight request has been accepted, and it makes the actual request. On the actual request, you only need the following header:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can learn more about preflight requests and handling CORS requests here: <a href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/</a></p>\n",
