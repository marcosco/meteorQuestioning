Remember, Facebook was around long before JQuery was considered standard.</p></li>\n<li><p>They likely will be supporting their existing code for many more years to come.  And the benefit to cost ratio of making a \"switch\" to a new language or framework may be too low to warrant a re-write or a transition.  Case in point: Sun didn't port much of Solaris to Java.  Only a marginal amount of Windows is written in C#.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you actually look at Facebook's website, their DOM structure isn't that complex.  They don't have very many animations.  They aren't a very heavy AJAX site.  Given that, JQuery may not be compelling for them.</p></li>\n<li><p>Also, when you have multiple teams contributing to a single software product (or web site), it's important that everyone standardize on the same framework.  If every team integrated with a different framework, then the code becomes bloated quickly with linkage of all these different libraries.  In the case of a website, this means longer page load times.</p></li>\n<li><p>JQuery is designed to support the largest set of browsers. In some cases, this might mean \"optimizing for the lowest common denominator\". FB may want to take advantage of newer browser features when available.</p></li>\n<li><p>FB may not want to get too \"locked in\" to JQuery.  JQuery was known to have a few bugs with some of the newer browsers that were in beta.  Now if Facebook has a million lines of code based on JQuery 1.6, it might be buggy when run on IE 10, FF 5, and Chrome 12 near year.  To make this work, they would have to upgrade to JQuery 1.7, but that means a huge amount of testing across their entire code base.</p></li>\n<li><p>Finally, they may have something internal that works better than JQuery.  I would not be surprised if Facebook already has a server-side framework that outputs HTML+JS based on the browser making the page request.  </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I recognize that none of these answers are very popular. What developer on your team doesn't want to switch to the latest and greatest technology? But when you think about the business case and cost of supporting a framework relative to the size of your business, you have to tread carefully.</p>\n",

Only subscribers get the events, so it isn't going to every scope in the system to make it work.  It is more complex, however, because you need to write your service with callback handlers, and you have to remember to unsubscribe.  The remembering to unsubscribe is pretty huge in my opinion.

                    "body": "<p>I'll try to answer question by question, but as you say, they're all closely related, so the answers overlap up to a point.<br>\nWhile reading this, bare in mind that I wrote this in one go, whilst feeling a bit feverish. I am not a V8 expert, and based this on recollections of my doing some digging in the V8 internals some time ago. The link at the bottom is to the official docs, and will of course contain more accurate and up-to-date information on the subject.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>What is going on</em></strong><br>\nWhat chrome's V8 engine <em>actually</em> does is create a hidden class for each object, and this class is mapped to the JS representation of the object.<br>\nOr as the people at google say so themselves:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To reduce the time required to access JavaScript properties, V8 does not use dynamic lookup to access properties. Instead, V8 dynamically creates hidden classes behind the scenes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What happens in your case, extending, creating a new constructor from a particular instance and overriding the <code>constructor</code> property is actually nothing more than what you can see on this graph:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DgSxj.png\" alt=\"Google inheritance graph\"></p>\n\n<p>Where hidden class C0 could be regarded as the standard <code>Object</code> class. Basically, V8 interprets your code, builds a set of C++ like classes, and creates an instance if needed. The JS objects you have are set to point to the different instances whenever you change/add a property.</p>\n\n<p>In your <code>create</code> function, this is -very likely- what is going on:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function create(proto)\n{//^ creates a new instance of the Function class -&gt; cf 1 in list below\n    function Created(){};//&lt;- new instance of Created hidden class, which extends Function cf 2\n    function Created.prototype = proto;//&lt;- assigns property to Created instance\n    return new Created;//&lt;- create new instance, cf 3 for details\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Right: <code>Function</code> is a native construct. The way V8 works means that there is a Function class that is referenced by all functions. They reference this class indirectly, though, because each function has its own specifcs, which are specified in a derived hidden class. <code>create</code>, then, should be seen as a reference to <code>create extends HiddenFunction</code> class.<br>\nOr, if you wish, in C++ syntax: <code>class create : public Hidden::Function{/*specifics here*/}</code></li>\n<li>The <code>Create</code> function references a hidden function identical to <code>create</code>. However, after declaring it, the class receives 1 propriety property, called <code>prototype</code>, so another hidden class is created, specifying this property. This is the basis of your constructor. Because the function body of <code>create</code>, where all of this happens, this is a given, and V8 will probably be clever enough to create these classes beforehand, anyway: in C++ pseudo-code, it'll look similar to code listing 1 below.<br>\nEach function call will assign a reference to a new instance Of the hidden class described above, to the <code>Created</code> name, which is local to <code>create</code>'s scope. Of course, the returned instance of <code>create</code> does still retain the reference to this instance, but that's how JS scopes work, and so this applies to all engines... think of closures and you'll get what I mean (I'm really struggling with this nasty fever... sorry to nag about this)</li>\n<li>At this stage <code>Create</code> points to an instance of this hidden class, which extends a class that extends a class (as I tried to explain in point 2). Using the <code>new</code> keyword triggers behaviour defined by the <code>Function</code> class, of course (as it's a JS language construct). This results in a hidden class to be created which is probably the same for all instances: it extends the native object, and this has a <code>constructor</code> property, which references the instance of <code>Created</code> we've just made. The instances returned by <code>create</code> though are all alike. Sure their constructors may have a different <code>prototype</code> property, but the objects they churn out all look the same. I'm fairly confident that V8 will only create 1 hidden class for the objects <code>create</code> returns. I can't see why the instances should require different hidden classes: their property names &amp; count are the same, but each instance references another instance, but that's what classes are for</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Anyway: code listing for item 2, a pseudo-code representation of what <code>Created</code> might look like in hidden-class terms:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//What a basic Function implementation might look like\nnamespace Hidden\n{//\"native\" JS types\n    class Function : public Object\n    {\n        //implement new keyword for constructors, differs from Object\n        public:\n            Function(...);//constructor, function body etc...\n            Object * operator new ( const Function &amp;);//JS references are more like pointers\n            int length;//functions have a magic length property\n            std::string name;\n    }\n}\nnamespace Script\n{//here we create classes for current script\n    class H_create : public Hidden::Function\n    {};\n    class H_Created : public Hidden::Function\n    {};//just a function\n    class H_Created_with_prototype : public H_Created\n    {//after declaring/creating a Created function, we add a property\n     //so V8 will create a hidden class. Optimizations may result in this class\n     // being the only one created, leaving out the H_Created class\n        public: \n            Hidden::Object prototype;\n    }\n    class H_create_returnVal : public Hidden::Object\n    {\n        public:\n            //the constructor receives the instance used as constructor\n            //which may be different for each instance of this value\n            H_create_returnVal(H_Created_with_prototype &amp;use_proto);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ignore any (likely) syntax oddities (it's been over a year since I wrote a line of C++), and ignoring namespaces and wacky names, The listed classes are, apart from the <code>Hidden::Function</code> effectively all the hidden classes that will ever need to be created to run your code. All your code then does is assign references to instances of these classes. The classes themselves don't take up much space in memory. And any other engine will create just as many objects, because they, too, need to comply with the ECMAScript specs.<br>\nSo I guess, looking at it like this, this sort of answers all your questions: no not all engines work like this, but this approach won't cause massive amounts of memory to be used, Yes, this does mean a lot of information/data/references to all objects is retained, but that's just an unavoidable, and in some cases happy side-effect of this approach.<br>\n<strong><em>Update</em></strong>: I did a bit more digging, and found an example of how you could add JS functions to V8 using templates, it illustrates how V8 translates JS objects/functions to C++ classes, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/v8/embed#templates\">see the example here</a></p>\n\n<p>This is just me speculating, but I wouldn't at all be surprized to learn that the way V8 works, and this retention business is heavily used in garbage-collection and memory management in general (EG: deleting a property changing hidden classes and the like)<Br>\nFor example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var foo = {};//foo points to hidden class Object instance (call id C0)\nfoo.bar = 123;//foo points to child of Object, which has a property bar (C1)\nfoo.zar = 'new';//foo points to child of C1, with property zar (C2)\ndelete foo.zar;//C2 level is no longer required, foo points to C1 again\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That last bit is just me guessing, but it <em>could</em> be possible for the GC to do this.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>What is this retention used for</em></strong><br>\nAs I said, in V8, a JS object is actually a sort-of pointer to a C++ class. Accessing properties (and this includes the magic properties of arrays, too!), is fast. Really, really fast. In theory, accessing a property is an <em>O(1)</em> operation.<br>\nThat's why, on IE: </p>\n\n<pre><code>var i,j;\nfor(i=0,j=arr.length;i&lt;j;++i) arr[i] += j;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is faster than:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (i=0;i&lt;arr.length;++i) arr[i] += arr.length;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While on chrome, <code>arr.length</code> is faster <a href=\"http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/32186/why-is-this-code-so-much-faster-relatively-in-ie7/32233\">as shown her</a>. I also answered that question, and it, too, contains some details on V8 you may want to check. It could be that my answer there doesn't (completely) apply anymore, because browsers and their engines change fast...</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>What about the memory</em></strong><br>\nNot a big problem. Yes, Chrome can be a bit of resource hog at times, but the JS isn't always to blame. Write clean code, and the memory footprint won't be too different on most browsers.<br>\nIf you create a huge constructor, then V8 will create a larger hidden class, but if that class specifies a lot of properties already, then chances of their being a need for additional hidden classes is smaller.<br>\nAnd of course, each function is an instance of the <code>Function</code> class. This being a native (and <em>very</em> important) type in a functional language will most likely be a highly optimized class anyway.<br>\nAnyway: as far as memory usage is concerned: V8 does a pretty good job managing memory. Far better than IE's of old, for example. So much so that the V8 engine is used for server-side JS (as in node.js), if memory really was an issue, then you wouldn't dream of running V8 on a server that must be up and running as much as possible, now would you?</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Is this just Chrome</em></strong><br>\nYes, in a way. V8 does have a special take on how it consumes and runs JS. Rather than JIT-compiling your code to bytecode and running that, it compiles the AST straight into machine code. Again, like the hidden-classes trickery, this is to increase performance.<br>\nI know I included this graph in my answer on CR, but just for completeness' sake: Here's a graph that shows the differences between chrome (bottom) and other JS engines (top)\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hZ7zg.jpg\" alt=\"Bytecode vs machine-code\"></p>\n\n<p>Notice that below the bytecode instructions and the CPU, there's an (orange) interpreter layer. That's what V8 doesn't need, owing to the JS being translated into machine code directly.<br>\nThe downside being that this makes certain optimizations harder to do, especially concerning the ones where DOM data and user input is being used in the code (for example: <code>someObject[document.getElementById('inputField').value]</code>) and that the initial processing of the code is harder on the CPU.<Br>\nThe upside is: once the code is compiled into machine code, it's the fastest you're going to get, and running the code is likely to cause less overhead. A bytecode interpreter is heavier on the CPU most of the time, that's why busy loops on FF and IE can cause the browser to alert the user of a <em>\"running script\"</em> asking them if they want to stop it.</p>\n\n<h1><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/v8/design?hl=en\">more on V8 internals here</a></h1>\n",

If you are familiar with casting, the coercing of a variable to a specific type, then the following should be reasonably clear to you.</p>\n\n<p><code>!</code> only operates on booleans.  Therefore, any variable you apply it to that is not boolean is first coerced to be a boolean before applying <code>!</code>.  To relate this to your examples:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Boolean(undefined) == false \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>undefined is sort of like null in javascript (there are some differences but that's a different topic).  It should make sense that the Boolean equivalent is <code>false</code>. <code>undefined</code> goes beyond just absence of value, it declares the variable you are trying to use doesn't even exist.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Boolean(function(){}) == true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Functions are objects in javascript. Even if it's empty, it still has some basic properties common to function objects and therefore its Boolean equivalent is <code>true</code>.  It's not nothing so it's something.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Boolean({}) == true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Like an empty function, <code>{}</code> defines an empty object. However, it still has some properties common to objects in javascript. It simply has no custom properties.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Boolean(null) == false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As I mentioned for <code>undefined</code>, <code>null</code> is similar but not quite the same. It indicates the absence of value.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Boolean(()) // error\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>()</code> on their own don't really mean anything.  You need something between them to make the syntax correct so this has no bearing on your false/true question. <code>()</code> alone is simply a syntax error.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Boolean(\"false\") == true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>\"false\"</code> is a string.  Just because it contains the letters f,a,l,s,e does not make it the same as the Boolean value <code>false</code>.  A non-empty string is something and therefore coerces to the Boolean <code>true</code>.  Note strings are kind of special objects in that an empty string <code>\"\"</code> coerces to <code>false</code> but an empty object, <code>{}</code>, as mentioned, coerces to <code>true</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Boolean(false) == false</p>\n\n<p>This one should be clear.  <code>false</code> is already a Boolean so casting it doesn't change its value. It's still <code>false</code>.</p>\n\n<p>From that, you can see how applying <code>!</code> to each case would give you the results you have seen.</p>\n\n<p>For further reading, here's a <a href=\"http://webreflection.blogspot.com/2010/10/javascript-coercion-demystified.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">pretty good article</a> on type coercion in javascript</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In regards to your <code>String</code> questions. There is a different between a <code>String</code> object and a string literal (something surrounded by quotes).  You can create a <code>String</code> object from a string literal but a literal is not automatically an object.  The same is true of numbers in javascript. JS has a <code>Number</code> object but you will often define numeric literals.  The behaviour of <code>Number</code> is consistent with what you've seen with <code>String</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>alert( new Number() == 0); //true\nalert(!0); //true\nalert(! new Number()); //false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, as you astutely mentioned in your comment:</p>\n\n<pre><code>alert( new String() === \"\"); //false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As the types are not the same; object vs. literal.</p>\n\n<p>In general, <code>Boolean(some_object)</code> will always evaluate to <code>true</code> but depending on the exact value, <code>Boolean(some_literal)</code> may evaluate to false.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ADDENDUM</strong></p>\n\n<p>Just because I shot myself in the foot earlier this week I thought this would be a useful piece of information to add.  In most languages an empty array, <code>[]</code>, will be coerced to <code>false</code>. However, in Javascript, arrays are objects so even the empty array coerces to <code>true</code>.  One to watch out for.  When switching between js and the various server side languages it's easy to make a slip up along the lines of <code>if(!maybe_empty_array){...}</code> which will never pass because <code>maybe_empty_array</code> will always coerce to <code>true</code>. Instead you should do <code>if(maybe_empty_array.length){...}</code>.  If the array is empty its length is 0 which safely coerces to <code>false</code>.</p>\n",

The view server compiles the strings in the design doc into function objects as they are executed, so if you close those functions over utility functions, constants or whatever, they'll be executable in map/reduce/show/list functions.</p>\n\n<p>Look for the place in the main.js file where \"emit\" and \"log\" are defined, and emulate the definition of those functions to expose your custom utility functions to your map and reduce lambdas.</p>\n\n<p>Caveat: Changing the view server without requiring a rebuild on your view will mean that your view index will not be correct.

Your URL concatenation is being \"sanitized\". </p>\n\n<p>You are already aware of the reason: <strong><em>XSS attacks</em></strong>.

Only the $scope service is directly available.

Basically, SCE <em>\"requires bindings in certain contexts to result in a value that is marked as safe to use for that context\"</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It is a protection mechanism provided by Angular to developers to easily protect (some aspects of) your app (this is even more important for apps that bind values based on user's input).</p>\n\n<p><strong>(2)</strong><br>\nSome places (i.e. attributes) are considered more vulnerable to certain kinds of attacks (e.g. XSS) and SCE uses more strict rules for them. A few examples are a form's <code>action</code> or a frame's or object's <code>src</code>/<code>ngSrc</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(3)</strong><br>\nBased on Angular's current implementation (v1.2.16), an error will be thrown when such a vulnerable attribute is assigned a value that consists of more than 1 \"part\". A part (accoding to <code>$interpolate</code> service's parsing algorithm is either a part of the expression enclosed in <code>{{</code> <code>}}</code> or a part of the expression that is outside of <code>{{</code> <code>}}</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In your case, <code>/resources/{{id}}/thumbnail</code> is parsed into 3 parts:<br>\n<code>/resources/</code>, <code>{{id}}</code>, <code>/thumbnail</code></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So, what is the problem with more than 1 part ???</p>\n\n<p>There is nothing inherently more insecure in concatenating in the view vs concatenating in the controller and using a single-part expression.</p>\n\n<p>Quoting from Angular's source (emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>// Concatenating expressions makes it hard to reason about whether some combination of<br>\n   // concatenated values are unsafe to use and could easily lead to XSS.  By requiring that a<br>\n   // single expression be used for iframe[src], object[src], etc., we ensure that the value<br>\n   // that's used is <strong>assigned or constructed by some JS code somewhere that is more testable</strong> or<br>\n   // <strong>make it obvious that you bound the value to some user controlled value</strong>.  This helps reduce<br>\n   // the load <strong>when auditing for XSS issues</strong>.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, it is Angular's way to force a \"more secure\" practice on you. Constructing the value in the view is <strong>less testable</strong> and <strong>less explicit</strong>, so you (or someone else) will have a harder time auditing the app for XSS vulnerabilities (increasing the probability of security issues).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There are a couple of ways (already mentioned in DaveA's answer) to circumvent this.\n(I would definitely not entirely disable <code>$sce</code>, though.)</p>\n",

So now, the behavior is that if you set width and height those are treated like presentational hints (just like width and height attributes for <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) and if you don't you get the default 300x150 intrinsic sizing which you can then override with style rules as desired.</p>\n",

For animation, I use <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I initiate it like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>self.animate = function()\n{\n    self.camera.lookAt(self.scene.position);\n\n    self.renderer.render(self.scene, self.camera);\n\n    if (self.willAnimate)\n        window.requestAnimationFrame(self.animate, self.renderer.domElement);\n}\n\nself.startAnimating = function()\n{\n    self.willAnimate = true;\n    self.animate();\n}\n\nself.stopAnimating = function()\n{\n    self.willAnimate = false;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I want to, I call the <code>startAnimating</code> method, and yes, it does work as intended. But, when I call the <code>stopAnimating</code> function, things break! There are no reported errors, though...</p>\n\n<p>The setup is basically like this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There is a <code>play</code> link on the page</li>\n<li>Once the user clicks the link, a renderer's <code>domElement</code> should fullscreen, and it does</li>\n<li>The <code>startAnimating</code> method is called and the renderer starts rendering stuff</li>\n<li>Once escape is clicked, I register an <code>fullscreenchange</code> event and execute the <code>stopAnimating</code> method</li>\n<li>The page tries to exit fullscreen, it does, but the entire document is completely blank</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm pretty sure my other code is OK, and that I'm somehow stopping <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> in a wrong way. My explanation probably sucked, so I uploaded the code to my website, you can see it happening here: <a href=\"http://banehq.com/Placeholdername/main.html\">http://banehq.com/Placeholdername/main.html</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the version where I don't try to call the animation methods, and fullscreening in and out works: <a href=\"http://banehq.com/Correct/Placeholdername/main.html\">http://banehq.com/Correct/Placeholdername/main.html</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Once <code>play</code> is clicked the first time, the game initializes and it's <code>start</code> method is executed. Once the fullscreen exits, the game's <code>stop</code> method is executed. Every other time that <code>play</code> has been clicked, the game only executes it's <code>start</code> method, because there is no need for it to be initialized again.</p>\n\n<p>Here's how it looks:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var playLinkHasBeenClicked = function()\n{\n    if (!started)\n    {\n        started = true;\n\n        game = new Game(container); //\"container\" is an empty div\n    }\n\n    game.start();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here's how the <code>start</code> and <code>stop</code> methods look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>self.start = function()\n{\n    self.container.appendChild(game.renderer.domElement); //Add the renderer's domElement to an empty div\n    THREEx.FullScreen.request(self.container);  //Request fullscreen on the div\n    self.renderer.setSize(screen.width, screen.height); //Adjust screensize\n\n    self.startAnimating();\n}\n\nself.stop = function()\n{\n    self.container.removeChild(game.renderer.domElement); //Remove the renderer from the div\n    self.renderer.setSize(0, 0); //I guess this isn't needed, but welp\n\n    self.stopAnimating();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The only difference between this and the working version is that <code>startAnimating</code> and <code>stopAnimating</code> method <strong>calls</strong> in <code>start</code> and <code>stop</code> methods are commented out.</p>\n",

The form isn't submitted. Javascript error: \"Access denied\". Doesn't matter how the form is invisible, as long as the dialog was opened with <code>input.click()</code> the form can't be submitted on change. (The onchange function is executed fine. The error only occurs when <code>form.submit()</code> is called.)</p>\n\n<p>Now all of this I can accept. IE sucks. I live with it.</p>\n\n<p>My solution so far was to check the <code>navigator</code> for \"MSIE\" and then when clicking the link instead of opening the dialog, showing the form (with the file input). Then the user has to click the actual, ugly file input and then everything works fine. But ugly.</p>\n\n<p>The question is twofold:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is there a way to do this in IE as cool as it is in Chrome? WITHOUT nasty flash/java crap. Only html elements andjavascript.</li>\n<li>If not: is there a way to check for form.submit() support after opening the dialog from a link (besides <code>!navigator.contains(\"MSIE\")</code>)?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>[2] could be catching the \"Access denied\" exception thrown in IE, but then it's too late: the user has already opened the dialog and browsed to the photo. You don't wanna make him do that again. (Even IE users don't deserve that.)</p>\n\n<p>PS. I'm only interested in Chrome 10+, Firefox 3.6+ and IE8+.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PS. Might be important:</strong> the file input element can't be anywhere near the link, because the link is inside a form and that form is (must be) separate from the file upload form.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong><br>\nSecond best: detect support for this high-techlike behaviour that only doesn't work in IE.   I don't wanna use <code>navigator.appName.contains('MSIE')</code> because that's not flexible and not necessarily true.</p>\n",

Details:</p>\n\n<p><code>link_to_function</code> was slated to be removed in Rails 3 (and was for a while when Rails 3 was in beta), but the function was put back in <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/d69e561\">https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/d69e561</a>. Several people wondered (aloud, in the comments of the commit) why the function was put back, when the big push in Rails 3 was for <a href=\"http://www.simonecarletti.com/blog/2010/06/unobtrusive-javascript-in-rails-3/\">Unobtrusive JavaScript</a>, so DHH chimed in:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is to handle non-generic function\n  triggers explicitly in ERb when you're\n  not inclined to manually hook it up\n  through JS. The big win for UJS in\n  Rails 3 is getting rid of big swaths\n  of boilerplate code ala data-confirm\n  and data-remote. These generics are\n  auto-wired and you don't have to\n  bother with it.</p>\n  \n  <p>But for your own functions, ala\n  link_to_function \"Add calendar\",\n  \"Calendar.add()\", this is a more\n  direct, immediate way to go. If you\n  still would rather go through an\n  external JS and wire it up by hand\n  through dom:ready, have a field day.</p>\n  \n  <p>The support for UJS in Rails 3 is not\n  about being dogmatic. Just like the\n  support for REST isn't. We'll expose\n  the major value to everyone and then\n  allow for outlets where it makes\n  since. Here, it makes sense.</p>\n  \n  <p>This, btw, is not about prototype or\n  any other specific js framework.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

As a UI feature it's generally frowned upon.)</p>\n\n<p>Since you can't get the original value of the <code>value</code> attribute at all, you would have to duplicate it in another attribute and fetch that. eg.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;form id=\"f\"&gt;\n\n&lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"foo\" value=\"bar\" class=\"value=bar\"/&gt;\n\nfunction resetForm() {\n    var f= document.getElementById('f');\n    f.reset();\n    f.elements.foo.value= Element_getClassValue(f.elements.foo, 'value');\n}\n\nfunction Element_getClassValue(el, classname) {\n    var prefix= classname+'=';\n    var classes= el.className.split(/\\s+/);\n    for (var i= classes.length; i--&gt;0;)\n        if (classes[i].substring(0, prefix.length)===prefix)\n            return classes[i].substring(prefix.length);\n    return '';\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Alternative ways of smuggling that value in might include HTML5 <code>data</code>, another spare attribute like <code>title</code>, an immediately-following <code>&lt;!-- comment --&gt;</code> to read the value from, explicit additional JS information, or extra hidden fields just to hold the default values.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever approach, it would have to clutter up the HTML; it can't be created by script at document ready time because some browsers will have already overridden the field's value with a remembered value (from a reload or back button press) by that time that code executes.</p>\n",

This is also why, instead of <em>\"finished\"</em>, a function is said to <em>\"have returned\"</em>.<br/>\nA function that lacks an explicit return statement will return <code>undefined</code>, like a C(++) function that has no return value is said (and its signature reflects this) to return <code>void</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void noReturn()//return type void\n{\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", 123);\n    return;//return nothing, can be left out, too\n}\n\n//in JS:\nfunction noReturn()\n{\n    console.log('123');//or evil document.write\n    return undefined;//&lt;-- write it or not, the result is the same\n    return;//&lt;-- same as return undefined\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also, in JS, like in most every language, you're free to simply ignore the return value of a function, which is done an awful lot:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(function()\n{\n    console.log('this function in an IIFE will return undefined, but we don\\'t care');\n}());\n//this expression evaluates to:\n(undefined);//but we don't care\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At some <em>very</em> low level, the return is translated into some sort of interrupt. If a function really returned <em>nothing</em> at all, there would be no way of knowing what and when to call the next function, or to call event handlers and the like.</p>\n\n<p>So to recap: No, a JS function needn't return anything as far as your code goes. But as far as the JS engines are concerned: a function <em>always</em> returns something, be it explicitly via a <code>return</code> statement, or implicitly. If a function returns implicitly, its return value will always be undefined.</p>\n",

That is fairly the fastest way to loop over an object. You could just use a <code>for-in</code> yourself and you save the overhead call.</p>\n\n<p>Another \"good\" way in terms of readabilty is to make usage of ES5 features like <code>.keys()</code> and <code>.map()</code>.

It's easy to map a transparent gradient to the background property, as lots  of people have shown, but that will leave the text unchanged.  </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I don't think there's any straightforward way to get the gradient effect that you want without making some compromises, depending on your needs they may be worthwhile solutions.  So to that end, here are two examples of how to achieve the effect shown in your example image, both using the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Faking it</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/LmqcV/2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Demo on JSLint.</a></p>\n\n<p>This is simple, you position a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element over your text block and draw in a gradient from fully transparent to the color of the background below the text block.  It's not really transparent, so it doesn't actually reveal any information below, but if you're trying to fade to a solid, predetermined color, then this works pretty well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Canvas text</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/4qmDm/3/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Demo on JSLint</a></p>\n\n<p>This example is more complicated, but fully replicates the transparent effect shown in your example.  Essentially, it ditches the HTML text block entirely, and just draws the whole shabang onto the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>. However, it has some downsides:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The canvas doesn't seem to like\nwrapping text, so you'd have to specify\nindividual lines.</p></li>\n<li><p>Canvas text may still have somewhat murky browser implementations.</p></li>\n<li><p>Accessibility &amp; SEO, though you could easily write a jQuery plugin for transforming regular DOM elements with text into this solution at runtime.</p></li>\n</ol>\n",

The <code>caller</code> property of \"bound\" functions (those created by ES5's <code>Function.prototype.bind</code> method) is also a poison pill.

I believe the same can be done in Eclipse using External Tools, if that's what you're more comfortable with.</p>\n\n<p>Using Mozilla Rhino is kinda nice. You aren't bothered by all the browser quirks out there and you get a pretty nice version of JavaScript to work with, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/New%5Fin%5FJavaScript%5F1.7\" rel=\"nofollow\">version 1.7</a>.

On the other hand though, the package ships with a debugger built with Java Swing. You can set break points right there and do all the things you'd do with a normal debugger.</p>\n\n<p>I've been using a binary version compiled by myself from the CVS sources as there was a bug in the implementations of iterators, which Norris Boyd fixed it immediately after I reported it.</p>\n",

It's best to use <code>link-to</code> so that your link URLs are kept in sync with your route URLs. The solution I use gives both an action to do the work and a handy <code>link-to</code> to index the pages.</p>\n\n<p>I override some functionality of <code>Ember.LinkView</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Ember.LinkView.reopen({\n  action: null,\n  _invoke: function(event){\n    var action = this.get('action');\n    if(action) {\n      // There was an action specified (in handlebars) so take custom action\n      event.preventDefault(); // prevent the browser from following the link as normal\n      if (this.bubbles === false) { event.stopPropagation(); }\n\n      // trigger the action on the controller\n      this.get('controller').send(action, this.get('actionParam'));\n      return false; \n    }           \n\n    // no action to take, handle the link-to normally\n    return this._super(event);\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I can specify which action to take and what to pass the action in Handlebars:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;span {{action 'view' this}}&gt;\n  {{#link-to 'post' action='view' actionParam=this}}\n    Post Title: {{title}}\n  {{/link-to}}\n&lt;/span&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the controller:</p>\n\n<pre><code>App.PostsIndexController = Ember.ArrayController.extend({\n  actions: {\n    view: function(post){\n      this.transitionToRoute('post', post);\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This way, when I cache a rendered copy of the page and serve that to an indexing bot, the bot will see a real link with an URL and follow it.  </p>\n\n<p>(note also that <code>transitionTo</code> is now deprecated in favour of <code>transitionToRoute</code>)</p>\n",
