You can import scripts.  I don't know what else you're asking about.  You can use an ajax call to fetch data if that will help you with your audio file.</p>\n\n<p>This sounds to me like you need to do some basic research about what you can and can't do with web workers (as there is a TON written about it on the web) and then come back with a lot more specific questions that incorporate that knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>There are no hacks for web workers that let you do more than you are supposed to be able to do.</p>\n\n<p>You can do work in the main JS thread and do it in little chunks with setTimeout if you have a lot of work to do and want to keep the main UI as responsive as possible.  This is a very old design pattern that goes back to the days before threading was available or easy to use.  It involves designing your work such that it can be done in little pieces with state stored in some persistent object and then you can repeatedly do small amounts of work and then return back, only to pick up the next piece of work on the next timer tick.</p>\n",

What do you expect when the user has disabled JavaScript? Are they allowed to see the contents of the page? If yes, add this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;noscript&gt;\n  &lt;style&gt;\n     .page{\n       visibility: visible;\n     }\n  &lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/noscript&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Otherwise, add <code>&lt;noscript&gt;JavaScript is required to read this page&lt;/noscript&gt;</code>.</p>\n",

In other words, start from scratch on another project.  Who knows?

Sorry but in my experience you just have to try it out in all the browsers and see what does and doesn't work. In the case of CSS <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_reference.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">this WC3 site</a> lists the different CSS properties and which browsers support them. In the case of Javascript <a href=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/\" rel=\"nofollow\">IntelliJ</a> had an Intellisense like feature that would tell you which browsers each Javascript function was supported in. If you don't have IntelliJ You can also read <a href=\"http://www.msdn.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSDN</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En\" rel=\"nofollow\">MDC</a> to find out more about specific browsers and which Javascript functions are supported. I would recommend using existing Javascript libraries (<a href=\"http://www.prototypejs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">prototype</a>,<a href=\"http://jquery.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">jquery</a>,...) to take care of the cross platform Javascript things for you. I would recommend writing your own XMLHttpRequest object that is cross browser compatible. It will give you a good idea of what the frameworks are doing for you.\n<br><br></p>\n\n<p>-Optimization for loading<br>\nThe senior project at my university was a web app used by 3000 people weekly. We stress tested the app and it was fine on the test data set. But in the wild with the real user data it ran slow on one of the URL requests. Long story short: a database query was running slow and it was not obvious why that was the case. We solved the problem simply because we had logging in place on the live application and were able to use a mysql profile tool on the live server to see exactly where the problem was taking place. Solve the optimization problem when you get there but do everything you can to prevent or mitigate the problem through logging and stress testing. \n<br><br></p>\n\n<p>-Session management, cookies<br>\n-Security (this is a biggie)<br>\nSession management/cookies and security kind of go hand in hand. Read about CSRF attacks (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001175.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>). New web frameworks have things in place to prevent this type of attack (<a href=\"http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/csrf/?from=olddocs\" rel=\"nofollow\">django</a>, <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/01/27/asp-net-mvc-1-0-release-candidate-now-available.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">ASP.NET MVC</a>). CSRF is an easy one to get burned on (it's happened to me and the big guys like YouTube and Google). It has happened to experts so it's not a simple problem. But CSRF and XSS seem to be the two big/common problems. One way to learn about them is to write an app that has one intentionally and exploit it and then fix it. The django templates when rendered will escape the variables preventing most XSS attacks.\n<br><br></p>\n\n<p>As for the frameworks doing magic: you are right they do and that is the point of the framework. And it can be frustrating when you want to understand what is going on underneath. The framework hides complexities you should never have to worry about building a web application. Think about it this way: a compiler is just as much magic. It takes a high level program and turns it into a low level one. One way to dispel the magic of the compiler is to learn assembly and C. Web frameworks are not different. To understand your tool sometimes it is best to build the tool. Write your own web framework maybe after you learned one. Write your own template language. Also learn a framework that is open source so you can answer questions about the \"magic\" it is doing. For example I wondered how django implemented the CSRF middleware. A quick look at the code and my question was answered. Most of the frameworks are well written so the code is usually readable. Just don't be afraid to look at it.</p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<p>that magic is lear</p>\n",

                    "body": "<p>Based on your comments, we need to go over how the <code>Bundling</code> mechanism works in MVC.</p>\n\n<p>When you set a bundle configuration as you have above (Example not from above to illustrate)</p>\n\n<pre><code>bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/mainJs\")\n      .Include(\"~/Scripts/mainSite.js\")\n      .Include(\"~/Scripts/helperStuff.js\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You then, in your views, call something like <code>@Scripts.Render(\"~/bundles/mainJs\")</code>.  When your web.config is set into a debug compilation <strong>OR</strong> you explicitly turn off bundling using the following line in your <code>BundleConfig.cs</code> file</p>\n\n<pre><code>BundleTable.EnableOptimizations = false;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, in your view, you will see the following rendered out</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script src=\"/Scripts/mainSite.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"/Scripts/helperStuff.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is the individual items that made up our bundle, uncompressed and listed individually.  The reason these list out individually in debug mode is so that you can debug your scripts and see them as you wrote them (actual variable names, etc).  </p>\n\n<p>Now, when we are not in a debug compilation and have not turned off the <code>EnableOptimizations</code> feature, MVC will combine those files in our bundles, compress (minify) them and output only a single script tag.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script src=\"/bundles/mainJs?v=someBigLongNumber\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice that the source is the same as the name of the bundle from the bundle configurations.  Also, the number after the <code>?v=</code> will change anytime you change a file in that bundle.  This is to help prevent caching of old js and css files by the client browsers.</p>\n\n<p>Your scripts are still there and being outputted, but they are being compressed and combined into a single file called <code>/bundles/mainJs</code>.  This feature is present to a) compress the files and reduce information being transmitted and b) reduce the number of calls to a website to retrieve the necessary content to render the page.  Nothing is missing, it sounds like everything is working as intended.  In a production site, the minification makes these files almost impossible to read, thus why the minification does not take affect while debugging.</p>\n\n<p>As to why the jQuery UI is still being a single JS file, ensure someone didn't hard code that into your layout view.  As for the JS errors, it could be errors that are present on your development box or perhaps something did not compress correctly (however, in all of my MVC development, I have not seen a JS error because of bad minification). </p>\n",

                    "body": "<p>Since the other answer didn't really answer anything about actually stopping an extension, I thought I would add my own two cents. Using the method in the other answer, you can <em>sometimes</em> detect if a particular extension is installed and react accordingly, but this requires you to test for a particular ID string and file for that particular extension. I am sure that we can all agree that this isn't a very encompassing solution. </p>\n\n<p>There are many things about extensions that you cannot stop from within your site, such as the <code>chrome.webRequest</code> api that adblock makes use of. There is nothing you can do to interfere directly with that sort of code, but there is plenty you can do on the DOM manipulation side. </p>\n\n<p><code>Content Scripts</code> operate in an <code>isolated world</code> meaning that they cannot see/interact with the javascript running on the site. They do, however, have complete access to the DOM and can do whatever they want to it. Conversely, your own javascript has the same access to that DOM. Taking advantage of that <code>isolated world</code> we can set up a <code>MutationObserver</code> to watch over the DOM and prevent any unwanted changes. Because of the <code>isolated world</code>, <code>content scripts</code> cannot disable or turn off our observer while our own javascript can do so freely. </p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of a <code>MutationObserver</code> that locks down the DOM with a little <code>jQuery</code> mixed in because I am lazy.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var config= {childList: true,\n             attributes: true,\n             characterData: true, \n             subtree: true, \n             attributeOldValue: true, \n             characterDataOldValue: true};\nvar observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutations){\n  mutations.forEach(function(mutation){\n    switch(mutation.type){\n      case \"attributes\":\n        observer.disconnect();\n        if(mutation.attributeName == \"class\")\n         mutation.target.className = mutation.oldValue;\n        else if(mutation.attributeName==\"id\"||mutation.attributeName==\"title\")\n         mutation.target[mutation.attributeName] = mutation.oldValue;\n        else if(mutation.attributeName == \"style\")\n          mutation.target.style.cssText = mutation.oldValue;\n        observer.observe(document,config);\n        break;\n      case \"characterData\":\n        observer.disconnect();\n        mutation.target.data = mutation.oldValue;\n        observer.observe(document,config);\n        break;\n      case \"childList\":\n        observer.disconnect();\n        if(mutation.addedNodes.length &gt; 0)\n          $(mutation.addedNodes[0]).remove();\n        if(mutation.removedNodes.length &gt; 0){\n          if(mutation.nextSibling)\n            $(mutation.removedNodes[0]).insertBefore(mutation.nextSibling);\n          else if(mutation.previousSibling)\n            $(mutation.removedNodes[0]).insertAfter(mutation.previousSibling);\n          else\n            $(mutation.removedNodes[0]).appendTo(mutation.target);\n        }\n        observer.observe(document,config);\n        break;\n    }\n  });\n});\n\n$(function(){\n  observer.observe(document,config);\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Throwing it into a chrome extension with a simple manifest such as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n  \"name\": \"DOM Polymerase\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"manifest_version\": 2,\n  \"permissions\": [\n    \"tabs\",\"&lt;all_urls&gt;\"\n  ],\n  \"content_scripts\": [{\n    \"matches\": [\"http://example.iana.org/*\"],\n    \"js\": [\"jquery-1.8.3.min.js\",\"polymerase.js\"]\n  }]\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And navigating to <a href=\"http://example.iana.org/\">http://example.iana.org/</a> will show that external manipulation of the DOM (except for some attributes, I didn't code them all in there) is no longer possible. Of course, in this case internal manipulation is also denied, but if the code was in the site instead of an extension, it would be a different story. While this doesn't disable extensions completely, it should at least preserve your DOM.</p>\n",

But the way I'm creating my variables, they're not attached to any DOM Element until i append the container to the actual page.</p>\n\n<p>So I was wondering if the previous code has better performance than using a document fragment that wraps it all like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();\nvar divContainer = document.createElement(\"div\"); divContainer.id=\"container\";\nvar divHeader = document.createElement(\"div\"); divHeader.id=\"header\";\nvar divData = document.createElement(\"div\"); divData.id=\"data\";\nvar divFooter = document.createElement(\"div\"); divFooter.id=\"footer\";\ndivContainer.appendChild( divHeader );\ndivContainer.appendChild( divData );\ndivContainer.appendChild( divFooter );\nfragment.appendChild( divContainer )\ndocument.getElementById(\"someElement\").appendChild( fragment.cloneNode(true) );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As I've already said, this is a question regarding performance, I know that as a best practice it's recommended to use fragments, but I can't take the thought out of my head that doing that just creates a new object in memory and does nothing, so I assume that ditching the fragment in this case is valid.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully some js guru / god will shine a light of hope in here and help us with this issue.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: So, I've been looking around for stuff related to this issue and it seems that documentFragments doesn't necessarily means better performance.</p>\n\n<p>It's just an \"in memory\" container of nodes. The difference between a fragment and say, a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is that the fragment has no parent and it will never be on the DOM, just in memory, which means that the operations made on the fragment are faster since there's no manipulation of the DOM.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#ID-B63ED1A3\" rel=\"nofollow\">W3C</a>'s documentation on documentFragments is very vague but to the point and also, everybody's favorite browser does not uses real fragments, instead it creates a new document according to <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536387%28VS.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">this MSDN documentation</a>. Which means, fragments on IE are slower.</p>\n\n<p><em>So, the question prevails, <strong>if I create an element</strong> (a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> for example) <strong>in a variable but DO NOT APPEND IT TO THE DOM, add elements</strong> (divs, tables, etc ) <strong>and stuff and after all the work has been done</strong> (loops, validations, styling of elements), <strong>that element is appended, is it the same as a fragment?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Given the fact that IE uses a \"fake\" fragment I'd say at least in IE using that approach (using an element such as a div, not a fragment) is better, I really don't care for IE but I need to test it ( office's policy ). </p>\n\n<p>Also, if I create all the html on an array like so: </p>\n\n<pre><code>var arrHTML = [\"&lt;table&gt;\",\"&lt;tr&gt;\", ....]; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then do this </p>\n\n<pre><code>document.getElementById(\"someElement\").innerHTML = arrHTML.join(\"\"); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It's way faster on IE, but other major browsers ( FF, Chrome, Safari and Opera ) perform better when using a container and then appending it (fragment or div).</p>\n\n<p>All of this is because the process to create all the elements is done really fast, around 8 - 10 seconds to create up to 20,000 rows with 24 columns, it's a lot of elements / tags, but the browser seems to freeze a few seconds when they're all appended at once, if I try and append them one by one, it's hell.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again folks, this is really interesting and fun.</p>\n",

The value of that object will be <code>1</code>, but you can change that value without loosing any specific methods you set to the object. </p>\n\n<p>There aren't very many advantages to storing numbers or strings in objects. AFAIK, the only thing you <em>\"gain\"</em> is a very, very, very slight performance difference over the constants when invoking certain methods, like <code>toExponential</code> etc... <br/>In my view, that isn't worth the trouble of creating objects for all numbers you're bound to use. I think of it as one of the <em>bad parts</em> of JS, meant to make the language look familiar to Java Applet developers. </p>\n\n<p>The second, without the new keyword, allows you to sort-of-type-cast: <code>Number(document.getElementById('formElem').value) === 123;</code> and has its uses (mainly with Date objects, in my experience). But then again, converting to a number can be achieved using the <code>+</code> operator, too: <code>+document.getElementById('formElem').value) === 123</code></p>\n\n<p>On the whole, just stay well clear of these primitive constructors. The only reason they're still there is because they're objects, and therefore have prototypes. Now <strong>THAT</strong> is an advantage:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Number.prototype.addOneToString = function()\n{\n    return (1+this).toString();\n};\nString.prototype.UpperFirst = function()\n{\n    return this.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + this.slice(1);\n}\nvar foo = new Number(3);\nfoo.addOneToString();//returns \"4\"\nfoo = new String('foo');\nfoo.UpperFirst();//Foo\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since JS wraps constant operands in an instance of its object counterpart, when the statement requires it, you can apply prototype methods (either native or self-made ones) to any constant. (Thanks to Pointy for this, and +1)</p>\n\n<pre><code>(3).addOneToString();//\"4\"\n'foo'.UpperFirst();//Foo\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So just regard them as legacy quirks, that are still there because of their prototypes.</p>\n",

The lookup table has 256 entries. Each entry contains the number of bits set in an unsigned 8-bit integer equal to the index of the entry. Iterating through the string and taking the unsigned 8-bit byte equal value to access the number of bits for that byte from the lookup table. Even for low-level language - such as assembler / machine code - the lookup table is the way to go... especially in an environment, where the microcode (instruction) can handle multiple bytes up to 256 or more in an (single CISC) instruction. </p>\n\n<p>Some notes: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>numberString * 1 and parseInt(numberStr) do about the same.</li>\n<li>there are some superfluous indentations, parenthesis,etc... supporting my brain in getting the semantics quicker... but some that I wanted to leave out, are actually required... when \nit comes to arithmetic operations with short-form, value-if-then-else expressions as terms.</li>\n<li>some formatting may look new to you; for examples, I use the continuation comma with the \ncontinuation on the same line as the continuation, and I 'close' things - half a tab - indented to the 'opening' item. </li>\n<li>All formatting is all done for the human, not the computer...

                    "body": "<h2>What I ended up doing</h2>\n\n<p>I added a sequencing function to my mini library of async helper functions. It basically runs a sequence of \"then\" calls, except that it adds extra intermediate steps to rethrow any exceptions that end up being caught by the Deferreds. It also accepts an optional error handler to catch the exceptions.</p>\n\n<p>When I call it it looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>go([\n    function(){\n        return 17;\n    },\n    function(x){\n        //return some stuff\n    },\n    function(){\n         var obj = a_function_that_returns_null_on_IE();\n         var x = obj.some_property; //BOOM!\n    }\n], function(){\n    //an optional error handler\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Another reason that I did things this way is that I have lots of code that needs to work simultaneously with either sync or async code (using Deferred.when to do the chaining). Using my custom function let me use a single, unified syntax and the errors not being captured in the async case is consistent with the sync case, where there are no Deferreds involved. I also think its OK to not capture the error, since unlike in the general case, when I am using \"go\" I know a-priori what code will be called, so there is no need to capture exceptions for if someone needs to catch them in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Also, using a custom solution gave me the freedom to enforce some personal design preferences :)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In addition to that, I ended up reducing the amount of exceptions I generate myself throughout the code base. Managing exceptions in async code is more annoying then usual and sometimes its simpler to just fallback into handling error conditions by returning null or an error code.</p>\n\n<p>Also, we made sure that any exceptions that we create ourselves are instances of the builtin Error class, intead of other objects. The reason is that the builtin Error class records the line number and stack trace of where it was generated in a kind of cross-browser way.</p>\n",

This is the only means of moving focus via the keyboard. (If you want to prevent mouse interaction with the rest of the document, that is a separate problem solved by covering it with an element to prevent any mouse events from getting through.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Finding all tabbable elements inside the modal element. These are a subset of all focusable elements, excluding those that have <code>tabindex=\"-1\"</code>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><code>Tab</code> goes forward. <code>Shift+Tab</code> goes backwards. Any time <code>Tab</code> is pressed while the last tabbable element in the modal element is focused, the first should receive focus. Similarly, any time <code>Shift+Tab</code> is pressed while the first tabbable element is focused, the last should receive focus. This will keep focus inside the modal element.</p>\n\n<p>The hard part is knowing which elements are tabbable. Since tabbable elements are all focusable elements that don't have <code>tabindex=\"-1\"</code>, then we need to know know which elements are focusable. Since there's no property to determine if an element is focusable, jQuery does it by <a href=\"http://brianwhitmer.blogspot.com/2009/05/jquery-ui-tabbable-what.html\">hard-coding the following cases</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>input</code>, <code>select</code>, <code>textarea</code>, <code>button</code>, and <code>object</code> elements that aren't disabled.</li>\n<li><code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements that have an <code>href</code> or have a numerical value for <code>tabindex</code> set.</li>\n<li>any element that has a numerical value for <code>tabindex</code> set.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It's not enough to check for these three cases. jQuery goes on to ensure that the element is visible. This means both of the following must be true:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>None of its ancestors are <code>display: none</code>.</li>\n<li>The computed value of <code>visibility</code> is <code>visible</code>. This means that the nearest ancestor to have <code>visibility</code> set must have a value of <code>visible</code>. If no ancestor has <code>visibility</code> set, then the computed value is <code>visible</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It should be noted that <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/\">jQuery's <code>:visible</code> selector</a> does not look correct for this implementation because it says \"elements with <code>visibility: hidden</code>\u2026are considered to be visible,\" but they are not focusable.</p>\n",

I would like for the tab key to cycle only through focusable elements inside the container element for the dialog box. What is the simplest way to do this?</p>\n\n<p>If possible, I am looking for a solution that doesn't care what the contents of the dialog or the rest of the page are and doesn't try to modify them. That is, I don't want to make the elements outside of the dialog not focusable, for example. First, this requires making a reversible change and keeping track of state. Second, this requires knowing all the possible ways an element could be made focusable. This feels messy, fragile, and unscalable to me.</p>\n\n<p>My first attempt looks like this, but works only in the forward direction (pressing Tab).

I've seen it used in a largish project and it was an absolute disaster ... maybe the worst technical choice made at that company.  RequireJS is designed to run in-browser and to asynchronously and recursively load JS dependencies.  That is a TERRIBLE idea.  Browsers suck at loading lots and lots of little files over the network; <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#num_http\" rel=\"nofollow\">every</a> <a href=\"http://blog.dynatrace.com/2010/04/05/web-performance-best-practices-how-masters-com-re-designed-their-site-to-boost-performance-and-what-that-re-design-missed/\" rel=\"nofollow\">single</a> <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/rtt\" rel=\"nofollow\">doc</a> on web performance will tell you this.  So you'll very very quickly end up needing a solution to smash your JS files together ... at which point, what's the point of having an in-browser dependency resolution mechanism?  And even though your production site will be smashed into a single JS file, with requireJS, your code must constantly assume that any dependency might or might not be loaded yet; in a complex project, this leads to thousands of async load barriers wrapping every interaction point between modules.  At my last company, we had some places where the closure stack was 12+ levels deep.  All that \"if loaded yet\" logic makes your code more complex and harder to work with.  It also bloats the code increasing the number of bytes sent to the client.  Plus, the client has to load the requireJS library itself, which burns another 14.4k. The size alone should tell you something about the level of feature creep in the requireJS project.  For comparison, the entire <a href=\"http://underscorejs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">underscore.js</a> toolkit is only 4k.</p>\n\n<p><em>What you want is a compile-time step for smashing JS together, not a heavyweight framework that will run in the browser....</em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>You should check out <a href=\"https://github.com/substack/node-browserify\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/substack/node-browserify</a></em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Browserify does exactly what you are asking for .... combines multiple NPM modules into a single JS file for distribution to the browser.  The consolidated code is functionally identical to the original code, and the overhead is low (approx 4k + 140 bytes per additional file, including the \"require('file')\" line).  If you are picky, you can cut out most of that 4k, which provides wrappers to emulate common node.js globals in the browser (eg \"process.nextTick()\").</p>\n",

JavaScript execution is single threaded, and whenever something outside of JavaScript triggers some JavaScript execution - whether it's a timeout firing, an event occurring, or a script loading - that JavaScript gets added to a queue of callbacks waiting to fire, which get executed sequentially. In most browsers, there's one JavaScript thread, and one queue, per browser tab. In Safari, there's one thread full stop, which is shared between all tabs - meaning that slow JavaScript in one tab can delay your event handlers from firing in another tab.</p>\n\n<p>This leads to a couple of ways that our attempt to calculate the time between events can get horribly screwed up if we try to calculate it based upon the times that the handlers run. Consider the following two scenarios:</p>\n\n<em>First scenario</em>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Some computationally expensive JavaScript starts executing that will take 1 second to execute.</li>\n<li>The first event occurs (i.e. the user mouses down on the target element)</li>\n<li>200 milliseconds later, the second event occurs (i.e. the user mouses up on the target element).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What happens next? The computationally expensive JavaScript finishes running, and then <em>both event handlers fire in rapid succession</em>. Consequently, if you are timing the events by getting the current time when the handler fires, you will wrongly calculate the time between the events to be close to 0 milliseconds.</p>\n\n<em>Second scenario</em>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The first event occurs and its handler fires. It stores the current time in a variable for later reference, and then starts doing some computation that will take 1 second to complete.</li>\n<li>200 milliseconds after the first event is triggered, the second event is triggered.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What happens next? This time, of course, we will wrongly calculate the time between events as being approximately 1 second, because the <em>second</em> handler's execution gets delayed.</p>\n\n<p>You can observe this in action at <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/gagLxrsc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jsfiddle.net/gagLxrsc/</a>. Just click the button and observe that the calculated time difference between mousedown and mouseup is always roughly 1000ms.</p>\n\n<p>What can we do to stop this? Well, ideally, we want a way of getting the actual time an event occurred, <em>not</em> merely the time its handler fired. Does the DOM API offer us such a thing?</p>\n\n<p><em>Maybe.</em> It depends upon your browser. Events have a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.timeStamp\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>.timeStamp</code></a> property, which, according to some people's interpretation of spec, should provide the time the event occurred rather than the time the handler fired. However, this is not currently reliably true across all browsers.</p>\n\n<p>In Firefox, the <code>.timeStamp</code> property works the way we want it to - it gives a timestamp for when the mousedown or mouseup event occurred, rather than for when its handler began executing. In Chrome, however, the <code>.timeStamp</code> property gives us the time the handler fired. There is <a href=\"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85665\" rel=\"nofollow\">an open bug</a> on the bug tracker describing this behaviour, complete with a claim that Chrome's behaviour violates spec, but nobody has taken any action on it since it was opened over 2 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>For browsers like Chrome, there's nothing you can do to guarantee the correctness of the time differences you calculate between events, because you simply don't have access to any <em>reliable</em> information about when the event occurred. You may be able to mitigate the potential for inaccuracy by avoiding ever performing computationally expensive tasks that lock up the JavaScript thread - indeed, trying to do this is a good idea <em>anyway</em>, just to ensure your UI stays snappy and responsive and doesn't lag when the user hits a button. But if you fail at that, or if you're writing library or plugin code and don't know whether other JavaScript code on the page will do anything lengthy and expensive, then the risk of inaccuracy is unavoidable - you will simply have to tolerate it until such time as all browsers implement the <code>timeStamp</code> property the way that Firefox does. You still might as well use <code>.timeStamp</code> instead of <code>new Date()</code>, though, just to get more accurate results on the browsers that <em>do</em> implement <code>.timeStamp</code> properly.</p>\n\n<h3>Recap and examples</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/gagLxrsc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jsfiddle.net/gagLxrsc</a> is a fiddle that calculates the time between a <code>mousedown</code> and <code>mouseup</code> on a button by creating a <code>new Date()</code> inside the event handlers. The first handler hot sleeps for a second after doing this, delaying the second handler from firing. In both Chrome and Firefox, the calculated click duration will be approximately a second (i.e. it will be wrong).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/gagLxrsc/1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jsfiddle.net/gagLxrsc/1/</a> is a modified version of the fiddle. The only change is that the time that events occurred is determined using the event's <code>.timestamp</code> property. In Firefox, this fiddle calculates the duration of a click accurately, but in Chrome it is still wrong.</p>\n",

It's also a good idea to give a name to the function for determining node colour:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function getGradID(d){return \"linkGrad-\" + d.source.name + d.target.name;}\nfunction nodeColor(d) { return d.color = color(d.name.replace(/ .*/, \"\"));}\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Create a selection of <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/pservers.html#LinearGradients\"><code>&lt;linearGradient&gt;</code></a> objects within <code>&lt;defs&gt;</code> and join it to your link data, then set the stop offsets and line coordinates according to the source and target data objects.</p>\n\n<p>For your example, it probably will look fine if you just make all the gradients horizontal.  Since that's conveniently the default I thought all we would have to do is tell the gradient to fit to the size of the path it is painting:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var grads = defs.selectAll(\"linearGradient\")\n                 .data(graph.links, getLinkID);\n\ngrads.enter().append(\"linearGradient\")\n             .attr(\"id\", getGradID)\n             .attr(\"gradientUnits\", \"objectBoundingBox\"); //stretch to fit\n\ngrads.html(\"\") //erase any existing &lt;stop&gt; elements on update\n     .append(\"stop\")\n     .attr(\"offset\", \"0%\")\n     .attr(\"stop-color\", function(d){\n           return nodeColor( (d.source.x &lt;= d.target.x)? d.source: d.target) \n          });\n\ngrads.append(\"stop\")\n     .attr(\"offset\", \"100%\")\n     .attr(\"stop-color\", function(d){\n           return nodeColor( (d.source.x &gt; d.target.x)? d.source: d.target) \n          });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, when the path is a <em>completely</em> straight line, its bounding box doesn't exist (no matter how wide the stroke width), and the <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/CeAZQ/3/\">net result is the gradient doesn't get painted</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>So I had to switch to the more general pattern, in which the gradient is positioned and angled along the line between source and target:</p>\n\n<pre><code>grads.enter().append(\"linearGradient\")\n    .attr(\"id\", getGradID)\n    .attr(\"gradientUnits\", \"userSpaceOnUse\");\n\ngrads.attr(\"x1\", function(d){return d.source.x;})\n    .attr(\"y1\", function(d){return d.source.y;})\n    .attr(\"x2\", function(d){return d.target.x;})\n    .attr(\"y2\", function(d){return d.target.y;});\n\n/* and the stops set as before */\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Of course, now that the gradient is defined based on the coordinate system instead of based on the length of the path, you have to update those coordinates whenever a node moves, so I had to wrap those positioning statements in a function that I could call in the <code>dragmove()</code> function.</p></li>\n<li><p>Finally, when creating your link paths, set their fill to be a CSS <code>url()</code> function referencing the corresponding unique gradient id derived from the data (using the pre-defined utility function):</p>\n\n<pre><code>link.style(\"stroke\", function(d){\n    return \"url(#\" + getGradID(d) + \")\";\n})\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/CeAZQ/4/\"><strong>Voila!</strong></a><br>\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/G29k3.gif\" alt=\"Sankey diagram with custom gradients from the data\" title=\"Oooh, pretty colours!

                    "body": "<p>assiming:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var someStr = 'He said \"Hello, my name is Foo\"';\nconsole.log(someStr.replace(/['\"]+/g, ''));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That should do the trick... (if your goal is to replace <em>all</em> double quotes).<br/>\nHere's how it works:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>['\"]</code> is a character class, matches both single and double quotes. you can replace this with <code>\"</code> to only match double quotes.</li>\n<li><code>+</code>: one or more quotes, chars, as defined by the preceding char-class (optional)</li>\n<li><code>g</code>: the <em>global</em> flag. This tells JS to apply the regex to the entire string. If you omit this, you'll only replace a single char.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you're trying to remove a the quotes around a given string (ie in pairs), things get a bit trickier. You'll have to use lookaround assertions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var str = 'remove \"foo\" delimiting double quotes';\nconsole.log(str.replace(/\"([^\"]+(?=\"))\"/g, '$1'));\n//logs remove foo delimiting quotes\nstr = 'remove only \"foo\" delimiting \"';//note trailing \" at the end\nconsole.log(str.replace(/\"([^\"]+(?=\"))\"/g, '$1'));\n//logs remove only foo delimiting \"&lt;-- trailing double quote is not removed\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Regex explained:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>\"</code>: literal, matches any literal <code>\"</code></li>\n<li><code>(</code>: begin capturing group. Whatever is between the parentheses (<code>()</code>) will be captured, and can be used in the replacement value.</li>\n<li><code>[^\"]+</code>: Character class, matches <em>all</em> chars, except <code>\"</code> 1 or more times</li>\n<li><code>(?=\")</code>: zero-width (as in not captured) positive lookahead assertion. The previous match will only be valid if it's followed by a <code>\"</code> literal</li>\n<li><code>)</code>: end capturing group, we've captured everything in between the opening closing <code>\"</code></li>\n<li><code>\"</code>: another literal, cf list item one</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The replacement is <code>'$1'</code>, this is a back-reference to the first captured group, being <code>[^\" ]+</code>, or everyting in between the double quotes. The pattern matches both the quotes and what's inbetween them, but replaces it only with what's in between the quotes, thus effectively removing them.<Br/>\nWhat it does is <code>some \"string with\" quotes</code> -> replaces <code>\"string with\"</code> with -> <code>string with</code>. Quotes gone, job done.</p>\n\n<p>If the quotes are <em>always</em> going to be at the begining and end of the string, then you could use this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>str.replace(/^\"(.+(?=\"$))\"$/, '$1');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With input <em><code>remove \"foo\" delimiting \"</code></em>, the output will remain unchanged, but change the input string to <em><code>\"remove \"foo\" delimiting quotes\"</code></em>, and you'll end up with <code>remove \"foo\" delimiting quotes</code> as output.</p>\n\n<p>Explanation:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>^\"</code>: matches the beginning of the string <code>^</code> and a <code>\"</code>. If the string does not start with a <code>\"</code>, the expression already fails here, and nothing is replaced.</li>\n<li><code>(.+(?=\"$))</code>: matches (and captures) everything, including double quotes one or more times, provided the positive lookahead is true</li>\n<li><code>(?=\"$)</code>: the positive lookahead is much the same as above, only it specifies that the <code>\"</code> <em>must</em> be the end of the string (<code>$</code> === end)</li>\n<li><code>\"$</code>: matches that ending quote, but does not capture it</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The replacement is done in the same way as before: we replace the match (which includes the opening and closing quotes), with everything that was inside them. <br/>\nYou may have noticed I've omitted the <code>g</code> flag (for global BTW), because since we're processing the entire string, this expression only applies once.<br/>\nAn easier regex that does, pretty much, the same thing (there are internal difference of how the regex is compiled/applied) would be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>someStr.replace(/^\"(.+)\"$/,'$1');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As before <code>^\"</code> and <code>\"$</code> match the delimiting quotes at the start and end of a string, and the <code>(.+)</code> matches everything in between, and captures it. I've tried this regex, along side the one above (with lookahead assertion) and, admittedly, to my surprize found this one to be slightly slower. My guess would be that the lookaround assertion causes the previous expression to fail as soon as the engine determines there is no <code>\"</code> at the end of the string. Ah well, but if this is what you want/need, please <em>do read on</em>:</p>\n\n<p>However, in this last case, it's far safer, faster, more maintainable and just better to do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (str.charAt(0) === '\"' &amp;&amp; str.charAt(str.length -1) === '\"')\n{\n    console.log(str.substr(1,str.length -2));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, I'm checking if the first and last char in the string are double quotes. If they are, I'm using <code>substr</code> to <em>cut off</em> those first and last chars. Strings are zero-indexed, so the last char is the <code>charAt(str.length -1)</code>. <code>substr</code> expects 2 arguments, where the first is the offset from which the substring starts, the second is its length. Since we don't want the last char, anymore than we want the first, that length is <code>str.length - 2</code>. Easy-peazy.</p>\n\n<p><em>Tips</em>:</p>\n\n<p>More on lookaround assertions <a href=\"http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html\">can be found here</a><br/>\nRegex's are very useful (and IMO fun), can be a bit baffeling at first. <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/832257/javascript-multiple-replace/9514142#9514142\">Here's some more details, and links to resources</a> on the matter.<br/>\nIf you're not very comfortable using regex's just yet, you might want to consider using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var noQuotes = someStr.split('\"').join('');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If there's a lot of quotes in the string, this might even be faster than using regex's</p>\n",
