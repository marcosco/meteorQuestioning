        "body" : "<p>This is an assignment from my class. What I need to do is create a registration page. When the user presses the submit button, I have take all the information on the form and write it to an existing XML file using Javascript. This is done on the client side, only through HTML, Javascript, and XML. By the way, my Professor purposely did not teach us how to do this because he wants us to research on it by ourselves. Also, I'm not too familiar with Javascript, especially with the built in functions, if possible please explain what each line or method of code is doing.</p>\n\n<p>Let me begin, here's how my existing XML looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    <?xml version =\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n    <!--GGFGFGFVBFVVVHVBV-->\n    <PersonInfo>\n      <Person Usrname=\"Bob111\" Pswd=\"Smith111\" personid=\"111\" FirstName=\"Bob\" LastName=\"Smith\" DOB=\"01/01/1960\" Gender=\"M\" Title=\"Hello1\"> \n      </Person>\n    <!-- several more lines of <person> here --> \n    </PersonInfo>  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When saving the form data, it has to follow all the layout within , basically I would need Usrname, Pswd, personid, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, from what I understand, I have to create the XML line \"Person\" from my registration page once I press submit.

Basically I got the creating the XML file part down, but still need help with the rest of my stuff.  </p>\n\n<p>My goal is trying to take my form data and push it into my existing array, not overwrite it, add to it, so I can update my existing XML file with the new registration information. This is where I have absolutely no idea how to do. Some pointers would be nice.</p>\n",

I am not going to even try being accurate here, but hope to give you the right idea:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>JSON is a lightweight way to (de)serialize and pass key/value and lists of values around. It's light, it's easy, convenient and some would argue more readable than XML. Serialization/deserialization is easily done in all languages.</p></li>\n<li><p>XML is an extensible markup <em>language</em> that not only represents data but also specifies rules (or protocols if you like) about them.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This does not only have to do with just providing a schema. Since you mention XMPP which chooses XML to represent its protocols, consider the following example:</p>\n\n<p>Let's say that in some XML-based representation designed to exchange music information where an <code><album></code> element is defined.</p>\n\n<pre><code><album>The Contino Sessions</album>\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Clients developed to parse this XML will know how to interpret the tag. Now, Foo Bar might come later and build upon the protocol extending it as such:</p>\n\n<pre><code><album foobar:genre=\"Electronica\">The Contino Sessions</album>\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Old clients knowing nothing about the <code>foobar</code> namespace will continue working as usual ignoring the <code>foobar:genre</code>. Those enhanced to understand the <code>foobar</code> will parse the genre annotation. This illustrates by example how XML is not simply a data representation. Try thinking how you would do the same with JSON. You will find you can't with the same costraints. This is why it is very unlikely for instance that an XMPP implementation can be done in JSON. </p>\n\n<p>That said, XML carries its own burdens. It's hard to build good XML parsers. It's even hard to use XML for simple serialization. Human readability is an euphemism for headache when it comes to figuring out long documents etc.</p>\n\n<p>In short:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>When you merely pass data around JSON is fine and easy.</p></li>\n<li><p>When you develop a protocol which will be extended in different ways by third-parties XML is the way.</p></li>\n<li><p>Conversions back and forth are a BAD idea. You cannot merely convert XML to JSON.</p></li>\n</ul>\n",

JSON was perfect for that because data from the server mapped directly on JavaScript objects; hit a GET URL with Ajax and get back an object, no need for parsing or anything else. </p>\n\n<p>Those rich interfaces made JavaScript a very popular language and JSON obviously rode along and it's popularity made it become the best candidate to overthrow \"the angle bracket\".</p>\n\n<p>But XML has a long history behind it. It's a mature technology with lots of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML#Related_specifications\">accompanying specifications</a>. JSON is just catching up to those. </p>\n\n<p>Although <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-03\">the draft specification</a> expired in May 2011, the JSON Schema supporters think they <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/json-schema/browse_thread/thread/2527eadb13e796c0\">have reached a pretty close to final version</a> of the spec. So who knows what the future has in hold for JSON Schema.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I was surprised, to find only one php implementation [...] Does IETF draft for JSON schema is a serious work, since only few implementation exist on the server side (PHP) ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does this PHP implementation validate JSON as per the last version of the JSON Schema draft? If yes, is there a need for other implementations? Do you need lots of implementations to certify a specification is serious? That's just as saying that <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1525299/xpath-and-xslt-2-0-for-net\">XSLT 2.0 is not serious because Microsoft didn't bother to implement it</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As for your last question, incoming data needs to be validated. You don't take a user request and throw it to the server and \"hope it sticks\". You validate it; and JSON Schema is not the only way to validate JSON data, so don't assume that web developers using JSON do not deeply test their incoming request data.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, what I'm trying to say is that JSON can't fully replace XML, or the other way around. <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3536893/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-xml-and-json\">So use each technology where appropriate</a>.</p>\n",

One clumsy possibility is the <a href=\"http://validator.w3.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">W3C Markup Validator</a>.

So this means you're making a asynchronous request and need to specify a callback function before you do the send(). Here's an <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest#Asynchronous_request\" rel=\"nofollow\">example from the Mozilla Developer Network</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var oXHR = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\noXHR.open(\"GET\", \"http://www.mozilla.org/\", true);\n\noXHR.onreadystatechange = function (oEvent) {  \n    if (oXHR.readyState === 4) {  \n        if (oXHR.status === 200) {  \n          console.log(oXHR.responseText)  \n        } else {  \n           console.log(\"Error\", oXHR.statusText);  \n        }  \n    }  \n}; \n\noXHR.send(null);  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Second, since your getting a 101 error, you might have the wrong URL. So make sure that the URL you're making the request with, is correct. Also make sure that your server is capable of serving your \"quiz.xml\" file. </p>\n\n<p>You'll probably have to debug by simplifying/narrowing down where the problem is. So I'd start my making a easy synchronous request so you don't have you worry about the \"callback function\" stuff. So here's another example from MDN for making a synchronous request:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var request = new XMLHttpRequest();  \nrequest.open('GET', 'file:///home/user/file.json', false);   \nrequest.send(null);  \n\nif (request.status == 0)  \n    console.log(request.responseText); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also, if you're just starting out with Javascript, you should refer to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript\" rel=\"nofollow\">MDN</a> for Javascript API documentation/examples/tutorials. </p>\n",

Your main MOC needs to observe Save notifications and merge those changes.</p>\n\n<p>Or, make the new MOC be a child of your main MOC, and save directly into it, then it can save.</p>\n\n<p>If, however, your managed object context is of either NSMainQueueConcurrencyType or NSPrivateQueueConcurrency type (only way to do second option above), then you can just use its perfromBlock method...</p>\n\n<pre><code>[managedObjectContext performBlock:^{\n    // Do your MOC stuff in here\n}];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The bottom line is that a MOC can be created with one of three concurrency types.  If it is NSConfinementConcurrencyType, then you must not touch it outside the thread in which it was created.  If it is NSMainQueueConcurrencyType, you have to use performBlock* or only touch it in the main thread.  If it is NSPrivateConcurrencyType, you must use performBlock*.</p>\n",

It's not important to copy them inside the new project. you can create a corresponding file, if you want to overwrite a old value, then set it in the new ressource file:</p>\n\n<p>For example: Project A: \nstring.xml has the value: <code>name=\"app_name\" - application A</code>\n For the project B, it's just important to create in the string.xml a value with the same name to overwrite the old value: <code>name=\"app_name\" - application B</code>. This can also be applied for the color and others ressource.</p>\n\n<p>6 - If you want to change a image, you just need to use a different image, but with the name of the to overwritten image and put it at the same place of the Project B (for example drawable).</p>\n",
